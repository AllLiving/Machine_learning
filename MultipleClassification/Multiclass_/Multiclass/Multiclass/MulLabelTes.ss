HIG		i 'm compelled to rate this place even though it 's closed , on the hope that whatever restaurant lands here will take a cue from them . <sssss> i also hope that if the owner or staff ever check this they know that this restaurant will be missed , and i 'm sure i 'm not the only one to think that . <sssss> i 've eaten here more than any other restaurant in phoenix i think , i love to check out new places so a location really has to knock it out of the park for me to want to become a regular . <sssss> the service was always spot on . <sssss> they had the craziest designed bathrooms . <sssss> the owner was always on site making sure that things were going smoothly . <sssss> the cajun chicken pasta was killer ! <sssss> the burger on an english muffin with bbq sauce blew my socks off ! <sssss> the georgia peach tea drink was delicious and packed quite a punch . <sssss> as you drift off into the sunset local breeze , i wish you well ! <sssss> i 'll miss you !!!!
LOW		i love sunnyslope . <sssss> it 's my adopted hood and i really want this place to recognize it 's potential . <sssss> that means local businesses and great restaurants and bars . <sssss> i had never stopped in here before , and recently i was invited to meet up here and i have to say it was just `` meh '' . <sssss> i had the chicken mac and cheese but also tried the burnt ends . <sssss> it was underwhelming . <sssss> the food was n't bad , but it was n't good enough to lure me back here either . <sssss> decent drink specials though !
MID		everybody at the makeup counter was extremely helpful in showing me how to complete my tobias funke blue man costume and how to create a fake beard for my charlie costume . <sssss> i loved how knowledgeable the staff was , and i one person did n't know something , they would find another girl who could give you an answer . <sssss> -1 star because it can get a little pricey to complete the look and they try to upsell .
