MID		being a two-minute walk from maizie 's , i 've tried it many times ; both for dinner , for lunch , for business , for pleasure . <sssss> it is pretty consistent ... not great , but above average . <sssss> i mostly stick to sandwiches , which are good , albeit it a bit expensive for what you get -lrb- in my case , not full -rrb- . <sssss> the burgers are decent , and on monday nights at $ 3 , you ca n't lose . <sssss> the service is friendly there for the most part . <sssss> on one or two occasions , i felt like i did n't fit into the bartender 's `` urban scene '' and felt a bit uncomfortable , but for the most part , i 've had a lot of great conversations with the staff there . <sssss> they feel `` real '' .
HIG		finally checked out marcellino at their scottsdale location for the first time . <sssss> it 's as good as it always has been and the new location offers more space and a nice ambiance . <sssss> the food is still great , the service was very warm , and the whole atmosphere is still inviting and cozy . <sssss> i had feared their move to scottsdale would cause it to become overly trendy and lose focus , but i far undersold marcellino and his team . <sssss> and despite having great food , the prices are quite reasonable . <sssss> having dined in italy recently , i can say the experience here was on par with that and hope to i to return soon .
LOW		the service at this restaurant is horrible . <sssss> my friend and i had wanted to go to the phoenician lobby for burgers , but they were going to close , so we went here . <sssss> basically , delux is one of those places that charges you phoenician-like rates and puts on the same kind of politically correct show with the fancy-pants decor , but the service is at the same level as mcdonald 's . <sssss> first of all , the service is slow . <sssss> and the waiter was moderately unpleasant from the beginning . <sssss> and they sat us at a tiny table for 2 . <sssss> so far , no big deal . <sssss> but then the impatient staff comes over and kept trying to take away our dishes . <sssss> `` are you finished with that plate ? '' <sssss> , the waiter asked , when i was only half finished with the burger . <sssss> eventually , they swooped in and took the plate out without asking . <sssss> they also took other stuff of mine and threw it away . <sssss> the manager is some girl barely out of high school with a sassy attitude , and even before i explained my situation , you could tell she could care less . <sssss> -lrb- she eventually found some of my stuff , then lied and said it had n't been in the garbage . <sssss> -rrb- then , when the server sees me leaving no tip , he starts swearing at me , and when we leave , he makes a point to open the door and say `` thanks for nothing '' . <sssss> little did he realize that since i put the meal on my credit card , my friend left the tip in cash . <sssss> a 22 % tip . <sssss> so much for service . <sssss> we could have gone to the phoenician and they would have blown us kisses even if we did n't tip . <sssss> and if they would have taken my stuff and thrown it away without asking , they probably would have given me a free room . <sssss> that 's the difference between real class and service , and fakers like the kind who work at delux . <sssss> i am never going back ever again , and i 'm sure until the doors close , no one at delux will care about my return , or that of anyone else 's . <sssss> customers seem to be the impediment to their running what would otherwise be , in their opinion , a great restaurant .
LOW		in fairness , i went back to delux because i was with someone who wanted sweet potato fries and it was the most convenient place to go . <sssss> i figured i try to talk to a different manager . <sssss> the guy was actually very nice , and was nice again when i came in for dinner a month or so later .
MID		i 've been going to ticoz with friends and family for years ever since it opened . <sssss> it certainly does have a `` city '' vibe , so some people have been a bit surprised by that . <sssss> but the food is good . <sssss> i consistently go with people who say it 's better than their mexican aunt 's / mother 's / etc 's similar dish . <sssss> the service has gotten a little more spotty as of late , even when they are slow late at night . <sssss> but the happy hour deals are great and you have to check them out . <sssss> i 'd still recommend it , but do n't go too close to closing time .
LOW		the food is above average ; not the best , but certainly enjoyable . <sssss> the service is quite hit or miss ; more `` miss '' than `` hit '' . <sssss> i 'm pretty apathetic about this place ; i have a friend who lives right down the street and we enjoy going here and being left alone to chat , but it 's not something i 'd seek out . <sssss> what is nice , if it matters to you , is the atmosphere . <sssss> it 's quite sterile and borning , which makes sense considering it 's in a strip mall in chandler , but there are plenty of good indian places that are in dive environs , so a sterile , suburban-feeling place is a nice upgrade at times .
LOW		update 11/11/10 . <sssss> hostess was stuffy and could n't imagine someone would go there by themselves . <sssss> so she sat everyone before me then asked me when the rest of my party was coming . <sssss> no tables left , i sat at the bar not exactly in a great mood . <sssss> do n't sit at the bar if you want anyone to pay attention to you . <sssss> when they do , they wo n't be able to hear you , so they 'll throw their arms up in the arm and not bring you what you ordered , until the next bartender comes along and says their co-worker `` forgot '' . <sssss> service here must be consistently horrible . <sssss> i keep giving it another shot and always leave disappointed and in a worse mood than when i came . <sssss> true to form , the food was decent . <sssss> not great , not good , but decent . <sssss> but decent food + horrible service + attitude + getting elbowed in the head by the drunk guy standing next to you = no buenas dias for me .
LOW		went there before an asu game as two couples . <sssss> the server was pretty nice but very unprepared and kept forgetting things . <sssss> at one point , we made a bet that one girl would never get the lime in her beer that she ordered right when we sat down . <sssss> the bet against the lime won . <sssss> the manager did agree with us and worked to remedy the situation , but it took sooo long to get all of our food and drinks and half of it was messed up . <sssss> in no rush to return .
MID		helpful , friendly staff that does a nice job . <sssss> food is pretty good , although i keep trying the same two things over and over -lrb- i guess that confirms it 's good -rrb- . <sssss> i ca n't get on board with the whole gourmet burger thing that has spread like a cancer through every westernized country on the planet , but i like smashburger and had my girlfriend who had n't been there tell me recently that i must have mentioned that we should go there about 1,000 times . <sssss> has to count for something .
MID		i love the feel of this place . <sssss> it 's so homey and a bit blue-blood . <sssss> the ivy and classic architecture will never go out of style with me . <sssss> the now-paid parking on the south side is a bit annoying and faux-exclusive . <sssss> but the selection of the stores is interesting , even if not completely conducive to being a 20-something year old guy . <sssss> it 's just a fun hang-out with a few good eateries and places you ca n't find anywhere else .
LOW		i have to admit ; the food at the vig is actually halfway decent . <sssss> the service , on the other hand , is the problem . <sssss> i recently ate at the vig for the second time on a saturday night . <sssss> i found the service to be slow and a bit pretentious . <sssss> apparently my tip was n't large enough for the waiter , because when my credit card bill posted , they had added a tip to my bill . <sssss> i called the restaurant on a weekday when i figured they would have more time to help me , and after 15 minutes on hold , they basically blew me off . <sssss> i was polite and calm on the phone . <sssss> i told the manager i was overcharged and that i was more disturbed over the added tip because of the service i received . <sssss> i kind of felt like it was a bother for the small amount involved , but to me it was the principle involved . <sssss> the manager asked me to share with her why i was dissatisfied to help her improve her service , but i did n't want to relive the experience , nor did i really care if anything happened to the server . <sssss> i just wanted the money that was mysteriously added to my bill back . <sssss> you 'd think you 'd get an apology for wasting 25 minutes on the phone , most of it on hold , trying to solve their overcharging of you . <sssss> but i did n't . <sssss> instead , when the manager started to bust on me for not sharing my bad experience -lrb- to which i told her i did n't want to relive it -rrb- , she became very passive aggressive , hastily said `` have a nice night '' and hung up on me . <sssss> i do n't suppose i 'll be going back to the vig .
HIG		the service here is very good . <sssss> i 've been coming for years , even back to the days when it was less trendy/more traditional french countryside upstairs of the biltmore . <sssss> the waitstaff , despite the hip decor and occassionally foreign menu item , are very pleasant , not condescending , and quite helpful . <sssss> what 's great is that whether i go for a formal dinner for a special occasion , or with a friend to `` cheap '' it out for burgers and duck fries , the service is the same . <sssss> there are some great menu items and you could spend many visits exploring them . <sssss> goat cheese flatbread , gruyere pomme puree , lobster bisque , the burger , the salmon ... all rather good . <sssss> definitely a favorite in my rotation . <sssss> and nice decor to heighten the mood further .
MID		king 's is a great experience . <sssss> the food is fresh , well prepared , comes in a good portion size , and is served by attentive staff . <sssss> i even enjoy the decor of the restaurant ; it fits the bill quite well . <sssss> i 'm not saying it 's the best fish house ever , but considering the somewhat reasonable prices , it 's a safe bet .
HIG		this is one of my favorites . <sssss> the food is great , service is prompt and friendly . <sssss> the wait usually goes by quickly as you are able to get a drink at the bar and then next thing you know , they are summoning you to your table . <sssss> the last time we were there was for my husband 's birthday . <sssss> there were 5 adults and the total bill was about $ 250 , before the tip . <sssss> one of our favorites is the short rib , yummy , yummy . <sssss> it is so juicy and delicious . <sssss> we have never taken any home as there are never any leftovers . <sssss> it does get `` loud '' , but i like to call it `` lively '' . <sssss> we will be back again soon , i hope .
HIG		when it comes to sushi in the beautiful valley of the sun ... this is the place . <sssss> no reason to waste your time with other sushi joints . <sssss> sakana provides the freshest fish , best selection , and best value . <sssss> my husband likes the atmosphere ... always a good scene ... we will be back again , and again . <sssss> i had lunch at the 59th ave and 101 the other day for lunch . <sssss> smaller than the one on hayden , same layout and lots of great sushi .
MID		my husband and i took a chance last night and went to lon 's . <sssss> we had no reservations and opted to sit outside and the bartender waited on us . <sssss> we were able to enjoy the beautiful arizona cool evening and have a drink prior to ordering . <sssss> i had a glass of pinot and loved it . <sssss> my husband had a $ 12 grey goose and tonic , easy on the gg . <sssss> the sommelier assisted him with which wine to order for his pork tenderloins with chutney . <sssss> i had the special , blue nose seabass -lrb- i was hoping for the red nose , i guess they were out of season -rrb- . <sssss> we had the yellow tomato soup and best part was the grilled cheese piece of heaven . <sssss> i could have had a whole meal of that goodness . <sssss> the bread was light and crispy and the cheese was melt in your mouth -lrb- i believe -rrb- goat cheese . <sssss> the food was promptly served and we enjoyed every bite . <sssss> we had to have the dessert , which included tastes of tiramisu , creme brulee and chocolate napolean . <sssss> i ranked the creme brulee # 1 , tiramisu # 2 , my husband gave the number 1 to the tiramisu . <sssss> we will definitly be back and this time with reservations . <sssss> the burning fire wood , which we sat near , had us smelling like we were at a lake kegger by the end of the evening .
LOW		i do n't usually give out 2 stars . <sssss> i mean , i love food and i like to think of myself as an amateur `` foodie '' , but in the 3 times that i have been here i love the food , but am not diggin on the atmosphere and dirty and cramped tables . <sssss> plus , it was hot in there . <sssss> i enjoyed my summer salad and slice of margarita pizza , but thought to myself as i left , `` i really wish that i liked this place more , i mean , i live close and drive by almost everyday '' ... can anyone who owns this good food/poor atmosphere place get a consultant in there to take this place to the next level ? <sssss> just a thought ...
LOW		i had lunch there today and the jive turkey sandwich left much to be desired , like some cranberry sauce . <sssss> i ended up just eating the turkey meat which was very moist and delicious . <sssss> i enjoyed the mixed greens with balsamic vinegar dressing and left the tomatos and bread . <sssss> i may try it again in the future .
LOW		i stopped by for lunch and had the bento teriaki chicken . <sssss> it was not good . <sssss> the salad dressing on the side salad was maybe home made and that was not a good thing . <sssss> the miso and the california roll were the only pieces of `` food '' that i enjoyed . <sssss> it was $ 15 for the bento and not worth it . <sssss> the food is cheap , the egg rolls were from a box of frozen , mass-produced egg rolls and the chicken was warmed in the microwave , cut and then the sauce on top . <sssss> so disappointing . <sssss> the place looked cool enough , but with the high prices and cheap food , their time is limited unless they start making some serious changes . <sssss> iron chef ... not .
MID		wew had a pedi at sundrops and then a drink or two at the grind . <sssss> i thought it was a coffee shop . <sssss> we had the wings , which were tasty . <sssss> they were not the typical bar wings and that is why we enjoyed them so . <sssss> i am looking forward to coming back for a full meal . <sssss> the bartender is super cool and the flat screen tvs were as well .
HIG		we had drinks which were very good and we had appetizers . <sssss> i picked the chicken , franks and waflle . <sssss> delicious-ness ! <sssss> and we had the duck fat fries with tomato jam , which were okay . <sssss> i want to go back for dinner . <sssss> we did see donovan mcnabb have dinner there , so that was kinda cool .
MID		i did not have the pizza though my husband said that it was delicious . <sssss> i had the steak salad and it was very nice . <sssss> i love the atmosphere and service was great . <sssss> we definitely will be back !
LOW		i have been here a few times before the diner , drive-ins and dives over the yeart . <sssss> the only item i have had and really enjoyed was the meat ball sandwich . <sssss> i was there recently and had the meatball sandwich which i had such fond memories of enjoying and it was okay . <sssss> so , if i am in the area , i will give it another try . <sssss> and one more thing , the guiseppe 's on scottsdale rd did have better meat ball sandwiches .
MID		okay , i am half korean and i love this place . <sssss> i have been here twice for lunch and had the chicken bulgogi . <sssss> the kimchi 's were all awesome . <sssss> it does not have the best atmosphere , the service is so-so , but the food is delicious . <sssss> it reminds me of my mom 's cooking . <sssss> i am so glad that i found this place and look forward to being on the east side of the valley so i can go there for lunch again .
MID		this is my second time here and i like it . <sssss> the service was quick , delightful and considerate . <sssss> they were busy for lunch and it took a while to get our rolls . <sssss> the food was tasty and just enough to fill our tummies .
MID		i got ta say/write , durant 's is a good place to go . <sssss> it 's an experience that lives up to the hype . <sssss> there is a lot of atmosphere here , folks . <sssss> so , come on , enjoy it . <sssss> it is not the chain joint that we 've all grown accustomed to . <sssss> durant 's is a great place to go for birthdays , special occasions , guests , etc. . <sssss> . <sssss> i love the velvet red walls . <sssss> you do n't see that everywhere these days .
MID		wonderful place with great food . <sssss> the place could use some updating but i still like it .
MID		what a great find this morning . <sssss> i was driving west on thomas trying to find a quick place for a snack and as i was heading north on 40th st. . <sssss> . <sssss> there is is , bertha 's cafe . <sssss> now that sounds good . <sssss> i go in , and though it looked like it was closed , luckily it was not . <sssss> i had a breakfast burrito with turkey and i enjoyed the red velvet cupcake while i waited for my food . <sssss> the lemonade was decent , they went too easy on the sugar , which may be a decent thing for my health . <sssss> anyway , i had to eat and run . <sssss> but i know that i will make way back there soon . <sssss> the cinnamon buns looked awesome !
MID		the pizzas are great . <sssss> my husband loves , loves , loves the padre . <sssss> the hamburger and salads are so delicious . <sssss> the parking can be a challenge . <sssss> just be patient , go early or late and pray for a good spot . <sssss> valet parking is a decent option . <sssss> we have brought our 3 year old daughter there for dinner and she does okay for a toddler . <sssss> we just promise her a gelato from next door . <sssss> actually , we end up buying the gelato and she eats that while we eat dinner and box up her meal for later .
MID		i have had lunch here several times in the past and enjoy each time . <sssss> this past week i had a bento box with chicken . <sssss> it comes with rice , kimchi , -lrb- a variety of choices -rrb- ca roll -lrb- 3 pieces -rrb- and the main dish of chopped , grilled chicken . <sssss> it was very enjoyable . <sssss> the staff is quick and friendly . <sssss> i will definitely be back .
HIG		i live in the neighborhood and finally stopped by for check this updated coffee shop and i am so happy that i did . <sssss> i had a latte with almond milk -lrb- yes , finally a place that has something more to offer than soy milk -rrb- which was delicious and i felt even better that knowing my dollars were going to a local business . <sssss> then i had to stop by today for lunch . <sssss> the le grande tuna sandwich was great . <sssss> i had a lot of food for not a lot of $ $ and it tasted great . <sssss> i will be back and often , especially when they start serving dinner . <sssss> thanks 32 shea . <sssss> i am so glad that you are here .
MID		and they cater parties . <sssss> that is how i was introduced to americas taco shop and i love it .
MID		i really enjoy this place . <sssss> i have been here twice and it has great music , tasty drinks/wine , yummy pizza , cool atmosphere and interesting bathrooms . <sssss> i like it a lot and look forward to another date night with my hubbie at hanny 's .
HIG		this has to be my absolute favorite for special occasions and all other occasions for that matter . <sssss> the wait staff is prompt and professional . <sssss> the food , from beginning to end is overwhelmingly delicious . <sssss> i love it ; the breads , salads , soups , main courses , desserts , wine , drinks . <sssss> it is all so good . <sssss> i ca n't wait to go back , hopefully soon . <sssss> a couple of years ago , we saw senator mccain with his wife and 2 other couples there at dinner . <sssss> wonder if we will see a blog from him for vincent 's on yelp.com ... hmm ?
LOW		too greasy . <sssss> i am sure that is their plan . <sssss> grease and salt the heck out of the food , so people will need to drink more beer . <sssss> we will never the go there again .
LOW		i have lived in phoenix for just over a year and my fiancé surprised with a two night stay at the royal palms resort for my birthday this past weekend . <sssss> this resort has always been at the top of my list to stay since every time we drive past it , the entrance looks incredible . <sssss> i was more than thrilled when i found out we would be spending two nights there ! <sssss> since my fiancé had to work one of the days , he invited my girlfriends to accompany me to the hotel pool . <sssss> upon arriving , the resort was as impressive as i had hoped for and we were greeted nicely by the valet service . <sssss> we asked for self parking and was directed to go down to the garage located nearby . <sssss> the other two cars ended up using valet but they were n't offered the self parking option and ended up tipping the valet . <sssss> no big deal but the option would have been nice . <sssss> the reception area is a small room with two love seats and while intimate , it was n't as grand as i expected . <sssss> checkin was fast but since we arrived at 9:30 am i was told that we could use the pool until the room was ready and we could change in the spa . <sssss> we made our way to the spa and the grounds are very beautiful . <sssss> everything is green and lush , a big contrast from the desert this time of year . <sssss> there are lots of fountains and intimate seating arrangements through out the property . <sssss> the spa staff was friendly but the spa did seem a bit small . <sssss> the locker area was small and only two stalls with toilets and another two shower stalls . <sssss> again , this is a boutique resort though and it matched the architecture and the finishes were all nice in the area . <sssss> the pool chairs are very comfy and have large towels that wo n't slip down the chair . <sssss> i was surprised to see that one of the towels on my girlfriend 's chair was nearly warn through in several places . <sssss> that 's not something you see in a five star resort . <sssss> friendly wait staff came by within 10 minutes and gave us each a big plastic cup of lemon water . <sssss> the pool is small but there were numerous chairs around the pool . <sssss> the pool temperature was great and the landscaping was very nice . <sssss> something that was really disappointing was there was no music . <sssss> after looking around further , i realized there are n't speakers except in the bathroom . <sssss> i 've never been to a resort pool without music so it was a bit ... quiet . <sssss> i 'm all for quiet and relaxing but at times , it was too quite . <sssss> on the second day there was a family there with their kids and it made their splashing and loud talking all the more noticeable . <sssss> also , they had three pool floaters that had definitely seen better days . <sssss> i 'm not sure why this resort would n't replace them ? <sssss> it seems like such a small , easy and inexpensive thing to do . <sssss> pool service was a bit sparse and several times we had to make our way to the bar to order items . <sssss> we always had to ask for everything which was unusual . <sssss> menus , towels , water ... nothing seemed preemptive on their end . <sssss> additionally , the second day , the area was a mess . <sssss> towels everywhere , chairs not setup for the next guest , empty drinks on several tables . <sssss> i think there was only one person working but i still would n't expect to see that at a resort of this caliber . <sssss> there were also several ugly crows in the area that were very aggressive . <sssss> one landed on my friend as she ate her lunch and the waiter told us a story of how just the other day one dive bombed a customer and took her taco . <sssss> ummm , are n't there bird wranglers or something ? <sssss> our room was ready by 12pm and we were in an upgraded valencia casita . <sssss> we were way in the back of the property and were directly next to another resort . <sssss> upon entering the room , they did have a nice plate of chocolate fudge and fruit and said happy birthday on the plate . <sssss> unfortunately , my birthday was n't until the next day but it was a nice gesture . <sssss> the room was nice but it did seem a bit dark . <sssss> the ceilings were low and the exposed beams on the ceiling added to the feeling . <sssss> the furnishings and the bathroom finishes were nice . <sssss> the tile floors added some character and it was nice having a keurig machine in the room . <sssss> the shower had great pressure and nice tile . <sssss> our bed was comfy but it was really high off the ground so it was a definite jump to get in . <sssss> the pillows were both flat , one down and one regular cotton fill . <sssss> the nightly turn down service gave you two tiny water bottles on your bedside and filled the ice bucket . <sssss> on our second day , we left the room at 10am and returned at 2pm and the room had yet to be cleaned . <sssss> our turndown service came around 7:30 pm the second day and left a dirty plate outside our door . <sssss> overall , the resort is nice but that 's just it . <sssss> nice . <sssss> for the value and the reputation , it was n't up to my expectations . <sssss> i expected to be wowed by this place but it just never happened .
MID		i went with a friend here on a sunday morning at 11am . <sssss> they were pretty busy but they got us both in with no problem . <sssss> i will say the chairs are angled so it was hard to talk to my friend so i just enjoyed the chair massage and watching the work . <sssss> lisa performed the $ 33 mani/pedi combo and did a wonderful job . <sssss> she really took her time to get the polish on perfectly and i really enjoyed the massage on both my legs and arms . <sssss> she also did two passes over my cuticles which i thought was above and beyond what you get in much more expensive salons ! <sssss> much better than any place i 've been around phoenix . <sssss> i 'll definitely make the drive to come back here !
MID		came here today for a quick , late lunch at 2pm . <sssss> they close at 3pm and are n't open on the weekends due to the lack of business after hours and on weekends . <sssss> too bad too because i could see coming here on the weekends . <sssss> the place is spotless and they had a great selection of drinks , even diet cherry pepsi ! <sssss> tons of different sandwich options and it was helpful to check out their menu online first or i could have easily stood there for 20 minutes trying to decide what to order . <sssss> i opted for the crackerjack and my fiance tried their new yorker . <sssss> both were warm and delicious ! <sssss> the sandwiches were both huge and only half was filling enough for both of us . <sssss> i love it when one meal can be spread out for lunch for two days . <sssss> we got to talk to the owner , nicole , who was very ny and very friendly . <sssss> she informed us that she no longer used boars head meats and was using a local supplier . <sssss> both our meats were great but having not too much bh before , i ca n't really compare . <sssss> she also mentioned that she offered cold-cuts for purchase so i may even come weekly and get some fresh slices for our own meals we make at home . <sssss> it was a bit unusual to see her packing a gun on her hip but i ca n't say i blame her either . <sssss> i knew many people would n't want to mess with her and that was before i saw the gun ! <sssss> lol she was friendly and seemed genuinely grateful for our business and i love supporting local businesses . <sssss> we 'll definitely come back !
LOW		stopped over here after dinner at the crescent ballroom for dessert and to mainly enjoy the atmosphere . <sssss> where else can you find a cool lit waterfall in the middle of downtown ?! <sssss> the hostess was really nice and let us pick any table we wanted outside . <sssss> there was only one other party outside but sitting near the waterfall did make it feel a bit cooler . <sssss> our waitress arrived shortly and we ordered the caramelized banana split for $ 8 . <sssss> when it arrived a short time later , its presentation was fairly fancy with one banana , split in half , caramelized -lrb- read : slightly burnt but in a good way -rrb- and one scoop of vanilla ice cream and everything covered in peanuts . <sssss> while it was good , for $ 8 it seems like it should have been a lot more considering all those ingredients combined probably cost $ 1 . <sssss> would it have broke the bank for two scoops ? <sssss> oh well , it hit the spot and we got to enjoy the neat little patio .
MID		i came here last friday with friends and a living social deal . <sssss> the deal on the living social website clearly said it included two cocktails , one appetizer and an entree of my choice . <sssss> when i brought up the deal on my phone , it showed it was only valid for the two drinks and one appetizer , no entree . <sssss> while that probably is n't the restaurant 's fault , it was pretty annoying but did n't try and prove the error and just decided to enjoy myself . <sssss> it 's also important to note that you ca n't use a ls deal before 6 or 6:30 -lrb- ca n't remember which now -rrb- . <sssss> hence the reason for the tiny print at the bottom that said ` reservations required ' . <sssss> luckily they kept me hydrated with water while we waited the 20 minutes for my deal to be good . <sssss> it 's a cute spot and initially i was sat outside because the happy hour was hoping inside and no tables were available . <sssss> i could see this patio as a really nice spot to come hang out once the weather cools off and enjoy their happy hour special of buy one bottle of wine , get the next one for $ 1 . <sssss> unfortunately i had a big group of smokers join me on the patio and that mixed with the misters was pretty gross . <sssss> being a former smoker , i appreciate my clean air ! <sssss> it would be nice if they could go somewhere else beside the patio . <sssss> having said that , the server was friendly , sat us inside after about a 10 minute wait and she had no issues using the ls deal . <sssss> i ordered the grapefruit martini and the peach fuzz fizz as drinks and both were delicious ! <sssss> for an appetizer i chose the peppy dew peppers . <sssss> i was n't sure what i was going to get but a new love of goat cheese prompted me to give them a try . <sssss> when 4 little peppers were brought out on a wooden board -lrb- for $ 8 -rrb- , i was a bit surprised at the small portions . <sssss> that was until i had my first bite . <sssss> they were incredible ! <sssss> i loved them ! <sssss> definitely crave worthy ! <sssss> each pepper was two bites , which equals about a $ 1 a bite . <sssss> worth every penny in my opinion ! <sssss> we also shared the salut fries , which were pretty good . <sssss> a nice dipping sauce would have really set them off though . <sssss> all entrees were pretty good -lrb- roasted corn salad with chicken -rrb- and while their salad plates were oddly proportioned and it looked like you did n't get much , the salad filled me up and was really good . <sssss> the server was great , attentive and friendly the whole night so i came out of there a happy camper that night . <sssss> fast forward to the next friday and i 'd been thinking about those peppers every day ! <sssss> i decided this time to take advantage of the localdines deal and head back for more of that pepper heaven and introduce my fiance to the best thing i 've eaten in awhile . <sssss> he agreed they were great ! <sssss> this time we opted for beers -lrb- hooray ! <sssss> they have papago orange blossom !! <sssss> -rrb- and shared a sun devil sandwich and the italian panini . <sssss> neither one was really great but i did eat more of the panini than the turkey burger and almost left my whole portion on my plate . <sssss> the poblano pepper on the burger was super hot and i had to take it off and the turkey was dry . <sssss> the panini was good , just nothing extraordinary . <sssss> our waitress was quite a bit slower this visit and never checked in with us so while it was n't quite as great as an overall experience as the first time , i still be back for those peppers !
LOW		visited here for lunch today . <sssss> i had been to the bar louie 's in kansas city previously so i felt comfortable enough to know what to expect and did n't felt compelled to check yelp reviews before arriving . <sssss> had i done so , i would n't have looked completely confused upon entering since there was no hostess stand or the typical ` seat yourself ' sign . <sssss> i found a bartender finally who confirmed you could sit anywhere and picked a seat inside but along the windows to still see outside . <sssss> the patio seemed nice but not enough umbrella 's to shade the tables at the 1pm sun and the atmosphere inside seemed more like a sports bar with the tv 's around the bar than the one i visited before . <sssss> no big deal , just different . <sssss> my waitress arrived several minutes later and provided menus while i was waiting for the other person in my party to join . <sssss> i was in the mood for salad and was excited to see all the varieties of salad options . <sssss> i ordered an ice tea and eventually the orange brie salad with the $ 4 upcharge for chicken at the recommendation of the waitress . <sssss> when my salad arrived , i was a little stunned . <sssss> for $ 12 , you usually get twice as much chicken and at least 30 % more of a salad and other ingredients . <sssss> as one of the other reviews stated , even my blackberries were cut in half and i got a total of two blackberries . <sssss> really ?!?! <sssss> in addition , i 'd say there was about half an orange and maybe 5 small to medium chunks of brie . <sssss> not what i was expecting for a full salad that was expected to be my meal . <sssss> this was just slightly larger than a dinner salad . <sssss> i will say that it did take me longer to eat than expected and i felt full when i left . <sssss> unfortunately though , 2 hours later i was hungry again . <sssss> what a waste of $ 12 . <sssss> the ice tea was descent though but $ 19 for a small salad and ice tea is way overpriced . <sssss> i could do better at mcdonalds for a same sized salad and drink for $ 5 . <sssss> do n't plan on returning .
HIG		i 'm not sure why i always forget about this place but every time i remember its there , i get excited about going back and do a happy dance ! <sssss> literally ! <sssss> this past weekend was no exception ! <sssss> service at the ordering counter is always great and everything looks so amazing . <sssss> i usually go for a full salad and get as much of their cherry salad dressing as possible . <sssss> the stuff is sooooo good . <sssss> one of the best salad dressings out there and my last visit , i saw full bottles for sale and while i decided to skip it since i 'd put it on everything , and should n't at 110 calories per 2tbsp , the ingredients list impressed me ! <sssss> a little high in calories but the ingredients were quality and i had no issues with eating it . <sssss> i opted for half a panini and half salad . <sssss> the salad was still amazing but the panini was a little less than what i expected . <sssss> it was good , but nothing special . <sssss> the next time i go back , i 'll be going back to my full salad . <sssss> also , there is a waiter here that is exceptional . <sssss> he anticipates your needs with refills and checks on you once your food arrives . <sssss> he is friendly , efficient and while he 's a bit hard for me to understand with his accent , he 's one of the best waiters i 've encountered in all of phoenix ! <sssss> great job !
MID		a friend of mine told me about this place and that she had been wanting to go forever so the next double date night we had , we opted to make reservations for the four of us . <sssss> i easily made reservations on their website through urban spoon for 8pm on saturday night . <sssss> we arrived a bit earlier than the other couple but were able to be sat at our table while we waited . <sssss> given the pictures i had seen online , our table seemed to be located in the less romantic room of the place . <sssss> we were in a back room with a table for four and two other tables for two . <sssss> while the house did have some character with the wood floors , as our other friends arrived they mentioned ' i think we 're in a kids bedroom ' . <sssss> there were n't any candles and the lights were up all the way so definitely not a romantic vibe . <sssss> we also had several visitors to the closet behind our table throughout our meal checking wires or something . <sssss> our server was good and her timing was great . <sssss> we inquired about the byob and it was $ 10 for the cork fee . <sssss> i 've never been to a restaurant where they do this so it was definitely new . <sssss> i 'm still undecided how i feel about having to pay them $ 10 per bottle to drink my own wine . <sssss> to each their own i guess . <sssss> all of the food was really good . <sssss> we ordered the three onion tarte and the other couple had the brie brûlée . <sssss> both were really good and different . <sssss> we shared the taleggio salad and while our waitress said all of the salads were incredible , i ca n't say i was overly impressed . <sssss> they did split it for us which is always welcomed but it did n't have anything memorable about it and i did n't care for the prickly pear dressing paired up with the fruit . <sssss> i was the only one at the table who ventured out for the filet and the other three ordered the pork tenderloin . <sssss> my filet was cooked perfectly and the tangy sauce was really good and complimented the steak really well ! <sssss> unfortunately the vegetable medley over the steak had mushrooms in it , something i do n't like and would have requested be left out of the dish but was n't specified on the menu . <sssss> i spent a lot of time picking through my plate as i ate . <sssss> the mash potatoes were good i think . <sssss> someone asked me the next day what came with my steak and i honestly did n't remember if it came with potatoes or not and had to look up the menu to refresh my memory . <sssss> maybe it was the wine . <sssss> for dessert we shared the peanut butter and chocolate pie dish , it was good , rich and only needed a few bites . <sssss> the dinner was perfectly timed and we were having such a good conversation , we ended up closing down the restaurant and they graciously never rushed us out of there . <sssss> the owner did stop by our table and was really friendly and i appreciated the attention . <sssss> overall , it was a pretty good visit and we might try it again once they move into their new location .
MID		came here on a random friday night after bookmarking it awhile ago after seeing the glowing reviews . <sssss> when we pulled up via pedicab , we realized this was the place they had been working on the last time we ventured into squashblossom . <sssss> the patio area looked nice but it was way too hot that night to sit outside so we opted for the dinning room . <sssss> when we walked in , the place was nearly full but we were greeted and sat near the back wall at a small table . <sssss> our waitress was friendly and we both ordered cocktails that were really good . <sssss> we opted to get the focaccia bread as an appetizer and then share the mango salad and peppino pizza . <sssss> i requested that the mango salad be made with other greens besides arugula . <sssss> as i mentioned in the zpizza review , since when has this crappy , peppery green become so fashionable ?!?! <sssss> if i want my salad to taste like an herb , i 'll add it , thank you very much . <sssss> when i asked for a substitution with one of the other greens listed on the menu , our waitress said they could n't really do it , that the salads were pre-made . <sssss> i probably should have opted for a different salad but she said it was a blend so i thought i could probably overlook it if there was n't a lot of it . <sssss> we received a basket of bread that was just okay in flavor . <sssss> it was nice and soft though and at first i thought it was the focaccia appetizer but then it arrived , nearly taking up our whole table ! <sssss> it was n't quite what i had expected though . <sssss> it was definitely flatbread that had been baked but the waitress advertised it as being able to be dipped in their homemade vinegar and oil . <sssss> that 's what sold me on it so i had expected some bread that actually soaked up the oil . <sssss> if you 've ever had a salad at gelato spot , it was a lot like their bread under their salads . <sssss> picture a really big , baked tortilla . <sssss> there 's not a lot there to soak up anything . <sssss> our salad came out next . <sssss> sadly , 10 % was baby lettuce and the rest arugula . <sssss> everything else on this salad was really good but the arugula overpowered every other flavor . <sssss> i would n't get it again and it would be nice if restaurants stopped serving this crap but i digress ... by the time we were done with our salads , our table was overflowing with dishes , drinks , bread , appetizers , water glasses , oils . <sssss> it was almost claustrophobic . <sssss> we ended up setting several things on the floor so we did n't dump anything . <sssss> the place is tiny so they ca n't have massive tables but it would be helpful if the staff paid a bit more attention to how much they put on our table and keeping it clear . <sssss> now for the reason for the 4 stars . <sssss> the pizza . <sssss> it was sooooo good . <sssss> everything was super fresh . <sssss> the cheese , the ricotta , the sauce , the sausage ! <sssss> this was probably the best tasting sausage i 've ever had on a pizza . <sssss> we devoured the entire thing like it was going to be snatched from us at any moment . <sssss> it blows pizzeria bianco out of the water and eases out over cibo with the crust and sauce and toppings just slightly . <sssss> once we sufficiently stuffed ourselves with pizza , the head chef came by our table and gave us each a shot of limoncello that was super strong and really good and some odd fried dough of some sort with powdered sugar . <sssss> all compliments of the house . <sssss> the dough was tasteless though so maybe they were just trying to give it away ? <sssss> i do appreciate the effort though . <sssss> the chef was nice enough to bring it over but definitely was n't overly friendly , smile or even thanked us for our business . <sssss> even after all the other faults of this place , i 'm still thinking about that pizza and its been a few weeks since we visited . <sssss> i 'll have no problem going back . <sssss> hopefully very soon !
MID		a girlfriend and i visited here for lunch today and it 's always amazing to me that in phoenix , so many neat places to eat are housed in generic strip malls that you would never know are there . <sssss> i almost missed the turn off just off the 51 but made it since there are two entrances into their parking lot . <sssss> ample parking outside and somehow missed the bbq smell as i walked up . <sssss> upon entering though , you realize this place is way cooler than most strip malls restaurants . <sssss> the atmosphere was really nice with big booths for larger groups and plenty of tables . <sssss> the lighting was great and reminded me a lot of the decor that 's popping up all over phoenix at places like central bistro and even olive and ivy a bit with their cool filament light bulbs . <sssss> we were invitied to sit anywhere and we opted for a booth/chairs table along the back wall . <sssss> the booth was comfy though it was a bit chilly in the place . <sssss> i need to start remembering to bring a sweater to restaurants during the summer ! <sssss> everything on the menu sounded really good so we opted for the grilled corn as an appetizer and i ordered the pulled pork with a side of the 50/50 potato salad and my friend ordered the brisket plate and a side of mashed potatoes . <sssss> our waitress , while handling what looked like 10 other tables , had perfect timing except for the one time we needed a diet coke refill and we had to flag her down . <sssss> other than that , she was great , friendly and always had a smile on her face . <sssss> overall i thought the food was pretty good . <sssss> the corn was a bit disappointing because i 'd hoped for more street corn with the creamy sauce drizzled on it but rather got two pieces of corn with some jalepeno spice that made it really hot ! <sssss> i 'm a bit of a weeny when it comes to hot so i only ate half but the corn did have good flavor . <sssss> the pulled pork was really good and i loved their coleslaw . <sssss> slightly sweet with not too many ingredients . <sssss> also on the plate came with two tortillas . <sssss> it seemed really strange at a bbq place and was n't in the mood but my friend said they tasted like ... surprise ! <sssss> ... a tortilla . <sssss> i had expected a slightly more ` deviled egg ' potato salad based off the ingredients list so it seemed to lack a little flavor so i probably would n't get it again . <sssss> my friends brisket on the other hand was delicious ! <sssss> coming from kc , finally there 's a place in phoenix that holds up to some of the bbq you can get there . <sssss> the meat was super tender , great sauce and i think she got 4 or 5 slices on her plate . <sssss> overall , love the atmosphere , fantastic service and i 'm excited to come back here for more bbq ! <sssss> i also just realized there was a local dines certificate to this place so i 'll definitely be coming back more frequently even though its a bit of a drive from downtown .
LOW		we have been back to this place three different times since our first incredible visit and sadly , none have been as good as the first . <sssss> the service has been good for the most part and the prices are still reasonable but the fajita 's have just not lived up to that first time . <sssss> the tortillas do n't seem as fluffy and light and the toppings seem less than quality . <sssss> i 'm not sure if its because that one time i was starving when we got there or if the quality has really gone down hill . <sssss> the cheese is bright orange , the tortillas seem overly heavy and smell of lard and the overall quality of ingredients just seem sub-par . <sssss> i do n't think after the 3 attempts of ordering the exact same meal to recreate our first experience , we 'll continue trying . <sssss> i do think the place is descent and would be okay if you 're really craving fajitas but do n't mind mid-grade food quality .
MID		since moving to phx from kc i 've been craving some good fajita 's and had yet to find any ... until we went to this place last night . <sssss> i 'd done a quick google search and this place kept coming up . <sssss> yes , we had to drive awhile to get there but it was totally worth it . <sssss> as other 's have said , its a little dark in the parking lot and the interior leaves a lot to be desired but that 's where the bad ended and the good started . <sssss> we were immediately greeted by a friendly young girl and sat right away . <sssss> our server anthony arrived promptly and took our drink order as we looked over the menu . <sssss> we opted to get the full pound -lrb- half shrimp and half chicken -rrb- to share and save us a few bucks . <sssss> the chips and salsa were really good with the salsa having a bit of a bite to it . <sssss> then the main attraction arrived . <sssss> holy cow ! <sssss> i 've never had tortillas like this ! <sssss> they were fresh off the grill and had this wonderful buttery smell . <sssss> after filling mine with chicken and all the toppings , i was in fajita heaven ! <sssss> these were the best i 've ever had . <sssss> my bf raved about the shrimp as well . <sssss> we proceeded to eat way more than we should have but when something is that good , its hard not to . <sssss> the guacamole side i ordered was good but i have had better so i might skip the $ 3 upcharge for it next time , but there will most definitely be a next time . <sssss> soon . <sssss> throughout our meal , anthony provided outstanding service in my book . <sssss> kept my diet coke full throughout and just filled it up , rather than asking , interrupting conversation as some waiters do . <sssss> he had perfected the unobtrusive service that i love , where they just take care of you and let you eat . <sssss> full drinks and constant tortillas as he anticipated our needs without us asking . <sssss> its rare to find that ! <sssss> we will definitely be back !
LOW		had lunch here with a friend on saturday at 11:30 . <sssss> located in what looks like a converted house , the sign was large enough that i did n't have any trouble spotting it on osborn . <sssss> there was plenty of parking and a quick glance at the patio , it looked really nice . <sssss> it was a bit confusing trying to figure out where to go in as one other person mentioned . <sssss> i 'm still not entirely sure where the front door is so it would be nice to have some signs . <sssss> someone finally let us in one of the doors at the front off the patio . <sssss> the place was nice and bright and i actually enjoyed the classic decor . <sssss> we were sat around back and only one other table had a couple enjoying their lunch . <sssss> our waiter came fast to greet us and went over the menu after he asked if we had been in before . <sssss> several things stood out to me on the menu but in the end we went with the fries as an appetizer , an upcharged mixed green salad to accompany my slow cooked chicken breast sandwich . <sssss> my friend ordered the kale salad and the rueben sandwich . <sssss> we seemed to sit for quite before our fries arrived but the fries were really good once they finally came out . <sssss> i was n't overly found of any of the dipping sauces ... the aioli did n't have a whole lot of flavor , the sauce vert was just strange and the truffle ketchup was ketchup with i guess , a hint of truffle . <sssss> having never had truffle anything , it was pretty good and i used it for my dip for the rest of the fries . <sssss> regular ketchup would have been just as enjoyable though . <sssss> about 1 minute after we received our appetizer , our sandwiches arrived . <sssss> this is one of my pet peeves . <sssss> . <sssss> it makes the meal rushed and always cramps the table . <sssss> maybe the advertised 3 or 4 times they fry the fries is what caused the delay ? <sssss> my sandwich was okay but it lacked a whole lot of the flavor . <sssss> the bread was soft but did n't have a lot of flavor , the tomato sauce was okay but again , lacked a lot of flavor . <sssss> i eventually opted to take the top off my sandwich and just eat the chicken to save a few calories from the lackluster bread . <sssss> the salad was really good though but they put the dressing directly on it , something i requested on the side . <sssss> my friend never mentioned anything about her sandwich so take that how you want . <sssss> the restaurant did seem to pick up by the time we were finished and our waiter repeatedly walked by our table and never asked if we needed anything else or to refill my diet coke . <sssss> i eventually had to flag him down for the refill ... and then again to get the check . <sssss> overall , cute place with forgettable food and some not so great service . <sssss> for a $ 24 lunch , i doubt i 'll come back .
HIG		oh al-hana , your garlic sauce will be the end of me . <sssss> this little spot in the baiz market is not located in the best part of town but is truly a gem . <sssss> my husband loves their schwarma sandwiches and i always get the chicken ta-ook -lrb- i apologize profusely for the atrocious spelling -rrb- . <sssss> i also love the tabouli . <sssss> we have also had their meat and cheese pies which are pretty good . <sssss> they have really good hummus and babaganoush . <sssss> the garlic sauce that comes with it is to die for and i always want to eat ungodly amounts of it . <sssss> pita bread and garlic sauce ... that could be my meal in itself . <sssss> love it . <sssss> i always like picking up a packages of pita bread while we are there . <sssss> i think we spend less than $ 1 for a pack of 6 pitas . <sssss> crazy cheap ! <sssss> would i go to baiz to buy groceries ? <sssss> not so much but we definitely make the drive for al-hana .
HIG		i do n't even know why i am addicted to this place but i am . <sssss> i unequivocably love sweet tomatoes . <sssss> this buffet is great for fresh food and the ability to dine healthy if you want . <sssss> i also love that our 2 year old can eat healthy for free . <sssss> for salads , you can choose from pre-made salads or create your own . <sssss> there is also a food theme depending on the time of the month which determines the specialty salads , soups , pasta , etc. . <sssss> there are usually 4-5 types of soups , baked potato , sweet potatoes , 2 types of pasta , muffins , breads , baked desserts , fruits , and ice cream . <sssss> my favorites are the homemade chicken noodle soup , their foccacia style sliced bread -lrb- so wonderfully garlicky -rrb- and their freaking lava cake . <sssss> their lava cake is always the end of me even when i try to eat reasonably . <sssss> what is also great for you sweet-tooth people , are the servers bringing around freshly baked chocolate chip cookies . <sssss> ah , sweet heaven ... or should i say , sweet tomatoes ...
HIG		after doing some research into grass-fed , pasture raised beef , i decided to make the switch from the corn-fed stuff you find at the grocery store and find a local butcher with high quality meat . <sssss> in come yelp and the meat shop ! <sssss> after reading the reviews , i decided to call ahead and place an order . <sssss> i ca n't remember the woman 's name i spoke to but she was really friendly , super helpful and suggested different cuts of meat for what i had on my menu for that week . <sssss> i was able to score some ground beef on sale that week so i picked up a few pounds of that -lrb- i normally do ground turkey but they do n't sell any poultry -rrb- and also some beef tip steak for a stir fry i was cooking . <sssss> while i was still a bit nervous about what to expect when i walked in , i found they were just as nice in person as they were on the phone . <sssss> pick up was easy and they had my order ready the same day . <sssss> as other 's have mentioned , the shop would be easy to miss driving down buckeye but they do have a sign out front that has helped me spot it both times i 've been . <sssss> the second purchase i made was for a new roast recipe i wanted to try out . <sssss> i should have asked before ordering a 3 pound beef roast because it was a bit more pricey than i 'm used to paying at the store . <sssss> $ 26 for 3 pounds . <sssss> i have no hesitation in paying for quality food , there was just a bit of sticker shock when he rang me up . <sssss> next time i 'll ask about pricing . <sssss> all in all , a great place though and i 'll be using them in the future for all my beef and pork choices . <sssss> now i just have to find chicken and turkey ! <sssss> message me if you know of any place that pasture raised chickens and turkeys that 's local !
HIG		we came here to satisy my sweet tooth and given that i am done with mary coyle . <sssss> i had only been here once before to get coffee and always meant to come back . <sssss> boy , am i glad i did ! <sssss> after dinner , the four of us took a walk down to pink spot . <sssss> i took a look at their menu online so i knew what i wanted . <sssss> i ordered the one scoop black-n-white sundae but substituted mint choco chip ice cream . <sssss> it was great . <sssss> the girl layered the brownie , hot fudge , and mint chocolate all the way to the top of the cup and topped it with whipped cream and nuts . <sssss> i loved the multiple layers . <sssss> we also got a chocolate covered banana for my husband -lrb- which caused endless jokes from me ... could not resist ! <sssss> -rrb- , and two kids ' ice cream scoops . <sssss> the total ? <sssss> $ 11 . <sssss> pretty shocking given i just spent a little over $ 8 for one regular ice cream sundae the other night at mary coyle . <sssss> everything was really good and the best part was we could burn calories walking to and from pink spot . <sssss> on the way out of this place , my husband noticed that they do bagel boxes -lrb- dozen bagels -rrb- for about $ 13 so i 'll definitely need to come here when i want to bring bagels for the office . <sssss> i would much rather support the local business than go to einstein 's for bagel buckets .
HIG		i freakin love the hell out of this place . <sssss> with my previously passed dog , i used to take him for the self-wash which ranges from $ 11 , i think to $ 17 . <sssss> this depends on the shampoo , etc that you use . <sssss> there are blowers to dry your pets , too . <sssss> for my newest dog , who does n't need as frequent baths , i take her often for the nail trims . <sssss> her nails grow so fast and it is convenient to walk in and get nails clipped for $ 8 . <sssss> i think i get more excited at the prospect of buying her treats at the bakery counter . <sssss> there is a great variety of biscuits , cookies , etc , and i love that they have `` muffins '' and `` cupcakes '' for your pets . <sssss> there is also a plenty of pet food , toys , and gear . <sssss> we also picked up some spray for shedding and sour apple spray for our puppy 's chewing . <sssss> they have a rewards card that sends you 5 % when you spend $ 500 . <sssss> wag-n-wash is definitely a one stop shop for pet owners !
MID		i always see a lot of my friends checking in here so i thought it was time to check it out . <sssss> my husband loved it more than me , but i thought it was decent . <sssss> i ordered one of the omelet specials which was really good . <sssss> it came with carmelized peaches on the side which were good but the cinnamon sauce/syrup had run all under my omelet . <sssss> i tried to eat around the egg parts that had n't absorbed the sauce but it was difficult . <sssss> maybe i am weird but i like some of those foods kept really separate . <sssss> my daughter had a blueberry pancake which was really good . <sssss> it seemed like they made it in a cast iron skillet which lended to the yummy cooked edges . <sssss> my husband 's omelet was good too .
LOW		after a recent trip to seattle , my husband has been on an asian food kick which encouraged him to finally try this place . <sssss> on his 3rd or 4th time eating there , he convinced me to order take-out . <sssss> normally , it had n't taken long to get his food in the past but this time , we sat in the parking lot for over a half hour . <sssss> apparently , everyone had to wait awhile . <sssss> i ordered the chicken/shrimp fried rice that was extremely flavorless and dry . <sssss> so disappointing as i have n't had a good fried rice in awhile . <sssss> my husband ordered banh-mi , spring rolls and another app that you basically put together -lrb- pork , vermicelli noodles , lettuce -rrb- . <sssss> i loved the banh-mi which was a sandwhich on a type of hoagie roll with pork , mayo , shredded carrot , cucumber and peppers . <sssss> i was so surprised at how much i loved the sandwhich . <sssss> the sandwiches are $ 2.25 and our whole bill was approx $ 17 . <sssss> i did n't exactly enjoy my meal but i think this place is definitely worth a try . <sssss> everyone has their off nights , right ?
LOW		generic soup , salad , sandwich place with lots of options . <sssss> i picked a soup and half sandwich combo , with the turkey avocado panini and chicken tortilla soup . <sssss> the sandwich looked so unappealing and did n't taste much better than that . <sssss> the soup was decent . <sssss> i liked the chocolate covered strawberry ... was n't expecting that . <sssss> i think this is a good addition to the plaza , but i would rather go to the biltmore for paradise bakery .
HIG		i absolutely love this place and truly wished i lived closer . <sssss> i am a big fan of outdoor malls and there is something for almost everyone here . <sssss> i say almost because there is only one store that my husband is interested in shopping in . <sssss> but ... this review is about me not him ! <sssss> ; -rrb- for me , i love the mix of more well-known clothing stores and local boutiques . <sssss> i love that there a number of different restaurants to suit your taste in addition to the cheaper eateries such as paradise bakery , chipotle , coldstone creamery , etc. . <sssss> in the summer , they have the misters going and in the winter , it is the fireplace . <sssss> there is also a harkins movie theater . <sssss> apart from the middle strip of shops , i like that i can hit up a target , ulta , bevmo in one stop . <sssss> who cares if i need to drive across the marketplace , the key thing is that i do n't have to drive across town to find shops that are all in one place ... so convenient . <sssss> i do n't get the parking complaints from other reviewers . <sssss> how is that the fault of the marketplace ? <sssss> there is an over-abundance of parking spots , but it can be hard to find a spot due its popularity . <sssss> if you are a bargain shopper , you can go to their website and print out coupons for its shops . <sssss> my husband and daughter got bogo frozen yogurt from mojo yogurt today . <sssss> there is also a little splash pad in the middle of the shops that is great for the little ones . <sssss> this is a great place to cover anything you might need .
HIG		i have n't been to zoe 's for probably a year but i always love it when i come ! <sssss> as i typically do , i recently had the grilled chicken plate which is grilled chicken with sauteed onions , and your choice of a side -lrb- i chose their rice-yummy -rrb- and their greek salad . <sssss> the salad is always huge so i usually save it for its own meal later . <sssss> their salad comes with their signature vinaigrette which is soooooo good . <sssss> we also got a pre-packaged side of their red potato salad which is good , itself , but i like to put the dressing on it , too . <sssss> my husband got the tuna pita and thought it was awesome . <sssss> my brother went for the mediterranean pita and raved about it , too . <sssss> the food is fresh and you feel you are eating healthy . <sssss> the prices are average for most places , nowadays and i think the grilled chicken plate at approx $ 7 is a pretty good deal when you can make two meals out of it . <sssss> oh yeah , their fountain lemonade was out when i went but my husband recommended i try their freshly squeezed limeade behind the counter . <sssss> i am a huge fan of limes and this was absolutely delicious . <sssss> not too tart or too sweet , just perfect . <sssss> love , love , love zoes .
MID		i stopped by here today on my way to the unfortunately closed rowdy boutique . <sssss> i figure what better way to cure my shopper woes by stuffing my face with a chocolate cupcake ? <sssss> okay , we got more than that but i had good intentions to stop at one . <sssss> anyways , for me , we got the milk chocolate chip cookie , brown velvet cupcake and chocolate cupcake . <sssss> for hubby , we got the urban cookie -lrb- dark chocolate , coconut , and oatmeal -rrb- , their speciality cookie : cherry , and a carrot cupcake . <sssss> the cookies are $ 1.79 and cupcakes $ 1.99 . <sssss> all i have eaten thus far is the chocolate cupcake and oh man , it was heaven . <sssss> the cake was very moist and the frosting was lick off my fingers delicious . <sssss> it tasted like a dark chocolate frosting so a hint of that dark chocolate bitterness . <sssss> yum , yum , yum . <sssss> now , i wonder if my husband will remember that he has a carrot cupcake or miss it if i snatch it up ??? <sssss> i suppose it is a little expensive but well worth it for those once in a while indulgences or to surprise someone with a sweet treat . <sssss> and sweet treat , it was ...
LOW		my husband and i came to celebrate the end of his mba program . <sssss> he is a major steak lover and loves these kinds of places but neither of us had ever been . <sssss> we had a reservation and were seated very promptly by the manager . <sssss> the server also had a slip of paper with our last names and greeted us as such . <sssss> we had two servers , jane and i ca n't remember the guy 's name . <sssss> jane had her spiel down -lrb- as i heard her repeat it to the table behind us -rrb- and was somewhat likeable . <sssss> i found her off-putting at times such as when she acted caught off-guard when i ordered an appetizer as my dinner . <sssss> then she smiled at me in an all-knowing way as if i was one of `` those '' girls ordering something small for dinner . <sssss> i did n't say anything but my husband caught on as he said something about it after she left the table . <sssss> then later i overheard her jokingly ask a gay male couple seated by us `` who is the mrs ? '' <sssss> when presenting their bill . <sssss> that rubbed me wrong way , too , but maybe i was being sensitive . <sssss> anyway , they brought a large warm onion loaf of bread . <sssss> it was okay ... i ate several pieces . <sssss> for dinner , we had the clams casino appetizer -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- , for my meal i had the baked prime platter -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- , my husband had the cajun ribeye -lrb- $ 47 -rrb- , bacon and onion mac-n-cheese -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- and parmesan truffle fries -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- . <sssss> everything was very good except the fries because they never brought it out ! <sssss> it was on the bill , though , so i am not sure what happened there . <sssss> they took it off when we brought it to their attention . <sssss> oh , that reminds me , jane and the other server apologized for the oversight but jane took it one step further by saying that at least it was n't her mistake . <sssss> tacky . <sssss> my baked seafood platter consisted of one breaded large shrimp , one bacon wrapped scallop , one oysters rockerfeller , and one small lump crab cake . <sssss> for $ 22 ????? <sssss> um okay ... the horseradish sauce they gave with it was amazing though . <sssss> my husband was in love with his steak . <sssss> i had a bite , too , and it was really good . <sssss> the mac-n-cheese was very cheesy and decadent . <sssss> for dessert , we had the small chocolate lava cake with a scoop of ice cream -lrb- $ 15 -rrb- . <sssss> i 'm not sure why jane said it took a half hour to cook but either way , it was very delicious . <sssss> adding a couple glasses of wine -lrb- it took awhile for my husband to be asked if he liked a second glass of wine-after his first had been empty for at least 10 minutes -rrb- , our bill came to $ 150 . <sssss> i knew it would be expensive but did n't care because it was a gift to my husband . <sssss> i just do n't get places like this . <sssss> the service was n't better than other places -lrb- and in some instance , worse -rrb- , and the food did n't wow me . <sssss> my husband had a good point that it could be hard to do that with seafood . <sssss> i tend to agree but at that price point and the amount of food , i should have loved it . <sssss> instead , it was comparable to places half the price . <sssss> my husband will probably go back ... but without me . <sssss> meh , not interested .
HIG		i have stopped into copper star on previous occasions , during street festivals , but today was the first time i came to sit and study . <sssss> man , am i a fan of this place . <sssss> i am lucky that i live in a location where i have a multitude of options -lrb- lux , lola , hob nobs , sbux , etc -rrb- but i have to say i really liked the vibe here . <sssss> the music was n't loud , the people relatively quiet and chill , and i could actually focus on what i was doing without getting too distracted by everything around me . <sssss> i liked that while on a busy street -lrb- 7th ave -rrb- , the entrance and windows actually face the side street it is on . <sssss> that added to the peace and quiet of it . <sssss> employees were nice , free wi-fi -lrb- internet key is needed but on a sign in the shop -rrb- , and i enjoyed my small , mint mocha with a chocolate chip cookie -lrb- both just under $ 7 -rrb- . <sssss> i was definitely eyeing the cupcakes in the bakery window but my tummy only had enough room for a cookie -lrb- which was soooo good if i might say -rrb- . <sssss> they are open until 9pm on sundays which is pretty cool . <sssss> i have yet to use their drive through for coffee , but they are open pretty early which is nice competition to sbux . <sssss> there is also outdoor seating which will be so nice when it starts to cool off ... you can give your dog a bath at wag-n-wash next door and then sit outside with them while you enjoy some local coffee .
MID		i always have a great time at fez . <sssss> sunday night was 50 % off of all bottles of wine and we had an excellent bottle of hob nob pinot noir . <sssss> service was friendly , atomosphere is always an interesting mix and my order the lamb kisra was good as always . <sssss> the food was out to our table really fast . <sssss> you ca n't miss with fez , i think it 's time for the pomegranite chicken again next time .
HIG		nordstrom razzle dazzle boom , your customer service sends me sailing away on a mediterranean dream seas . <sssss> i purchased an armani watch over a year ago . <sssss> i kept the receipt , i know , smart right ? <sssss> well to my dismay the movement died on it . <sssss> fast fix wanted to charge $ 65 and so i thought i would give it a shot to return it for store credit . <sssss> the mens watch service associate without hesitation offered to send it for warranty repair service since they did n't carry the model anymore . <sssss> i was tickled beyond belief . <sssss> she explained the wait time , and best of all no charge . <sssss> thanks nordstrom , you did it again .
HIG		updated and still great ... i took a break from putting up christmas decor . <sssss> i was in the mood for a torta so i decided to pop by . <sssss> since my last visit , the patio has been expanded with some sun shades . <sssss> art and the interior also have some bright updating done . <sssss> the staff is very friendly and helpful . <sssss> the guacamole is great and still a highlight for me . <sssss> i ordered the carne asada torta . <sssss> the food was out promptly and the music provides a great eclectic and urban feel . <sssss> happy hour deals are great and include some food items .
HIG		eat , drink , repeat . <sssss> this was a wonderful dinner . <sssss> we started with the tortilla espanola and my friend who went to spain recently said it was better than what he had in spain . <sssss> i ordered the salpicon de congrejo and it was very light and refreshing . <sssss> the waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable and down to earth . <sssss> we then ordered the pollo colonial and lomo con romesco . <sssss> the flavor was beyond belief , it was so pleasing to the palate . <sssss> my chicken had this wonderful crispiness that was yet still delicate and flavorful . <sssss> my glass of malbec was really good . <sssss> the owner also came to our table and asked how everything was and apologized for it the restaurant temperature being too cold , but we did not find it cold , so it was great to meet the owner . <sssss> to top it off i had a an almond desert that was unique . <sssss> the music and atmosphere was perfect , i ca n't wait to come here again , i know some folks have mentioned the portion sizes , but i found the key is to order a number of dishes together and share . <sssss> lastly , thanks groupon for the introduction , this place really stands out .
MID		ok , i 'll admit it , i get my once a week culver 's fix . <sssss> usually the delux double w/fries ... can you say good times . <sssss> i 've done the chicken sandwich once and was not impressed so i 'd stick with a burger which is very addictive . <sssss> ever since culver 's opened , i have not set foot in a wendys for their double . <sssss> reminds me of grilled goodness from the midwest . <sssss> friendly staff too .
LOW		upside lots of theatres , downside , the staff are as dumb as a box of rocks . <sssss> went to the new sherlock holmes film yesterday afternoon . <sssss> 20 people in line , one staffer , one staffer . <sssss> normally i would use the automated box to buy my ticket , but i had a gold pass . <sssss> do n't feel like gold using it though ! <sssss> this theatre is closest to me , but it drives me nuts when they ask if i want to join their pay for rewards program . <sssss> why would i want to pay for rewards to be your customer-shish . <sssss> by the way if you eat at a restaurant and have parked in the garage , validate at the theatre . <sssss> they validate longer . <sssss> i made the mistake of using validation once from my big fat greek and saved a whole dollar . <sssss> i repeat one whole dollar .
LOW		while i found the majority of things that i needed i had a run in with one of the female employees here . <sssss> i wish i remembered her name but her name tag should say attitude . <sssss> i was ready to check out and found an item that i think costco had a coupon for and i remembered that i did n't think i needed it since they automatically rang up . <sssss> i asked the associate if the register would ring it up automatically and she asked me in a snotty way , `` do you need to bring your coupons to other stores to get the discount off ? <sssss> i said yes and then she said well you have your answer . <sssss> i should have asked for a manager-she needs to be coached-badly . <sssss> i do n't usually go to this one anyways , the one off of i-17 and the 101 has much friendlier staff . <sssss> otherwise , this was an ok visit .
LOW		i think dillons had a grand opening or something . <sssss> i went yesterday early evening and it was unorganized amongst the staff . <sssss> the entryway was clogged with people and it was a cluster ... well ya know . <sssss> the building itself is in bad need of an interior makeover as the tables and booths look like they are at least 20 years old . <sssss> the appetizer was some beef bruschetta thing where the meat was cold on it . <sssss> i was not impressed . <sssss> however the entry was a chicken fried chicken and it was the down home comfort food i was craving and it was hot . <sssss> i felt sorry for the staff yesterday it looked like they were trying but were in need of a good manager . <sssss> maybe i 'll try the bbq sometime but will wait a bit to see if they get the kinks out of their service .
MID		best flavorful food out of all mexican fast casual restaurant chains . <sssss> my favorite two items are the tacos and the salad . <sssss> the tacos with grilled chicken rock ! <sssss> i added some of their ranch dressing and special crumble cheese to mine and they were wonderful . <sssss> the taco salads are great also . <sssss> lots of flavor . <sssss> unlike other previous reviewers i do not need a concierge to work my way through a fast casual restaurant . <sssss> read the website , take more than 2 minutes to read signage and ask questions if needed . <sssss> staff is friendly sometimes a little slow in the head but i do n't consider this full service . <sssss> they have daily specials unlike chipotle or qdoba and outdoor seating options . <sssss> check out the drink options , amazing refreshing choices like sugar free strawberry lemonade . <sssss> delicious
HIG		ice cream and yogurt -- step aside and exit please . <sssss> this place is tops in my book . <sssss> their are tons of flavors to choose from , you can also take in some samples and they have a flavor of the month . <sssss> seating indoors is a little limited but when the weather is decent plenty of spots outside to people watch and check out eye candy . <sssss> this is perfect way to skip the dessert at whatever restaurant you are at , and get one much more flavorful and worth the price . <sssss> my favorite flavors to date are the roche and the vanilla bean , perfect contrast . <sssss> staff is friendly and the music is kind of loungy . <sssss> i 've also gelato from other spots and it is no match , this is the most creamiest , flavorful gelato i 've had to date .
HIG		i hardly ever get downtown for lunch and had no idea where to go , so i sent out a tweet . <sssss> a couple people independently suggested cibo , so we met friends there . <sssss> the place is very a charming , a converted house with brick wall , chandeliers , and cool art . <sssss> they serve sandwiches and salads at lunch time . <sssss> i got the pastrami and mostly enjoyed it . <sssss> it was actually a little too rich with the fontina for my liking , but overall pretty good . <sssss> the bread was toasty and incredible . <sssss> the staff was great - nice , genuine and friendly . <sssss> i love when servers know how to strike the balance of being attentive while giving you time to talk with your company . <sssss> last , but best , we ordered dessert crepes . <sssss> this is where the 5th star comes in - oh my freaking god . <sssss> we got a suzette which has orange marmalde folded in and is topped with gran marnier which they light at the table . <sssss> we also got one stuffed with warm nutella and topped with powedered sugar . <sssss> it was absolute freaking ecstasy on a plate . <sssss> let me tell you - if you ever have a hot date , or an apology to make , do it over wine and dessert crepes at cibo .
HIG		we had a fabulous time at roka akor on friday night ! <sssss> they saved the day by being able to take our large group with little notice . <sssss> we met some friends early for drinks at the bar . <sssss> the service was a bit slow , but it was pretty busy . <sssss> i had a glass of wine , one of my girlfriends got a lovely blood orange margarita and the bartender made up a beautiful fruity non-alcoholic drink for my prego girlfriend . <sssss> we were shown to our table right on time and had a fabulous server -lrb- wish i could remember her name -rrb- who took the time to explain both the yelp eats menu , the regular menu and about the restaurant . <sssss> we 'd ordered a bottle of wine at the bar that was n't part of the yelp eats wine special but she honored it anyway . <sssss> from there on out , all i can remember is servers filling my wine glass and bringing dish after dish of wonderful food ! <sssss> i had the tempura sweet potato and white fish , both were delicious - i am looking forward to going back just for them ! <sssss> next , i had the spicy avocado sushi and the hamachi serrano chilli roll , which were some of the best sushi i 've had in a while . <sssss> hubby 's pork chop was cooked to perfection , too . <sssss> i ca n't remember the last time we went out and both agreed that the atmoshphere , food , price and service were great . <sssss> best of all , he had a great birthday and we had a very memorable time with our friends . <sssss> we will definitely be back !
HIG		had the best best time here tonight ! <sssss> my mama and best girlfriends treated to me a fun day for my birthday and i insisted on wrapping up the afternoon with happy hour on me . <sssss> i 've never been but we wanted to go somewhere nice and stopped in . <sssss> the restaurant is beautiful - we sat in a high back comfy booth in the bar which is really nice . <sssss> the bar has shelves of backlit colorful liquor bottles above it -lrb- ala the ocean club bar -rrb- . <sssss> we has 2 rounds , including the vitamin c martini , white chocolate martini , flirtini and black cherry cocktail - they were all really great ! <sssss> we also got the colossal shrimp appetizer -lrb- which technically were n't all that colossal , they were just normal -rrb- , the sliders -lrb- the bacon and maytag bleu cheese was amazing ! <sssss> -rrb- and the az eggrolls -lrb- a bit on the greasy side but very tasty and perfect for happy hour -rrb- . <sssss> the tab was only $ 65 -lrb- it was happy hour and the prices averaged about $ 6 / drink and app -rrb- . <sssss> the service was also extremely good . <sssss> it 's been a long time since i felt like raving about a restaurant - it was great !
HIG		this is one of my favorite restaurants for many reasons ! <sssss> the service is fantastic - roberto , the owner , and his wife susan are often at the restaurant , greeting guests and going table to table . <sssss> reservations are recommended -lrb- especially if you are going on a fri or sat night in season -rrb- , if you call ahead ask for wanda . <sssss> she is friendly and attentive , as is all the staff . <sssss> the prices are very reasonable - you will get a meal on par with mastro 's or flemings for half the price . <sssss> you ca n't go wrong with their fresh pastas or seafood , homemade garlic sausages and wonderful desserts -lrb- love the semifredo ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> they have consistently served fantastic food for the years my hubby and i have been going . <sssss> the wine list is extensive , you 'll be sure to find a favorite that wo n't break the bank , and do n't forget to end your meal with an espresso or limencello . <sssss> the atmosphere is great - relaxing , intimate , a place where you can talk with and enjoy the people with you . <sssss> also , do n't miss the monthly wine dinners in summer - they serve new dishes that are n't on the menu and are very generous with the pours .
MID		invited here for a meeting last week and really enjoyed it . <sssss> on a side note , i am surprised at how often i am getting invited to the indian school and miller area these days , lots of great little places down there . <sssss> the atmosphere is very cute , a big bright pink wall , black leather furniture and ultra chic fashion photos on another wall -lrb- one of my guests knows the owner , apparently he was the photographer ? <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> the pasties in case looked really lovely , and we had very attentive service . <sssss> our food was delicious - i had the the organic carrot veloute , a smooth and delicious soup accented with ginger and cilantro . <sssss> it was served with a bed of lettuce and dressing . <sssss> the only things that didnt thrill me were the salad -lrb- is it salad or garnish ? <sssss> if its a salad a couple slices of tomato and cucumber would be nice -rrb- and the price is a bit on the high side - $ 7 for the soup . <sssss> but the overall experience was great and we 'll be back .
HIG		i love this place ! <sssss> took my son yesterday morning . <sssss> it is always clean and well organized . <sssss> you can make a day of this park with so much to do ! <sssss> the park 's hours vary with the season but typically opens at 10am . <sssss> purchase your ride at the front office as you 're walking in . <sssss> the park has a fun train ride , carousel , a huge playground and large open fields with several ramadas for parties . <sssss> you can bring in your own food for a picnic or get lunch -lrb- things like chili , pizza , pb & j -rrb- just north of the train station or visit the snack bar near the carousel -lrb- ice cream , candy , popcorn , chips , coffee beverages -rrb- . <sssss> the prices are very reasonable , especially for ramada rental . <sssss> visit , you will love this place !
MID		went to lux for the first time yesterday to grab a hot tea and get some work done . <sssss> overall , it was a great experience and i am looking forward to returning . <sssss> the people who work there are pretty cool , they made me a couple great big mugs of hot tea and i had a crazy amazing brioche with huge chunks of sweet apples . <sssss> awwww yeahhhh ! <sssss> i would give it 5 stars but it is a bit on the pricey side , the atmosphere could be better and there are no seats at lunchtime . <sssss> i was standing around for a good 15 minutes like a jerk with my laptop waiting for someone to leave . <sssss> it seems like they might be able to make more room but its hard to say what the rest of the building is used for . <sssss> at any rate , the best thing about this place is n't the place , or even the coffee and food - its the people . <sssss> the employees are friendly and funny and the patrons are really , really cool . <sssss> i met 2 people there i knew from twitter who introduced me to another friend , who in turn introduced me to yet another person . <sssss> there is a great buzz in this place , lots of people thinking , working and talking all fueled by caffeine . <sssss> i had a ton of great conversation and thoroughly enjoyed myself . <sssss> looking forward to returning .
HIG		i 'd never been to sweet republic before , but we decided to host an event here -lrb- north valley friday night -rrb- on the last friday night of june . <sssss> the owners were very friendly and welcoming . <sssss> the place is really cute and their ice cream is amazing ! <sssss> i had the date ice cream paired with roquefort blue cheese ice cream . <sssss> it sounded crazy so i had to get it , and it was really really good ! <sssss> -lrb- for the less adventurous , s r offers normal flavors too , my son had mint chocolate chip -rrb- . <sssss> the home made brittle makes for a yummy topping and next time i plan to try one of their ice cream sandwiches - yummy ice cream in between two oversized cookies . <sssss> highly recommended !!
MID		stopped by here yesterday at happy hour ! <sssss> had a late lunch so a friend i shared the carrot souflee -lrb- it was good but not quite what we were picturing , guess we should 've asked ... -rrb- and a couple glass of wine -lrb- $ 4 at happy hour ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> regularly , all the wines are $ 6/glass or $ 20/bottle , even on wines that cost quite a bit more at other restaurants . <sssss> the service was a little on the slow side , but very friendly . <sssss> also really like the atmosphere , lime green white and black looks clean and modern but warm . <sssss> the outside seating area also looked really nice . <sssss> will definitely try it again for dinner soon .
HIG		i love bringing newbies to a place i know they are going to truly love . <sssss> such was tonight . <sssss> first , our watier , shawn , was amazing . <sssss> our guest likes to have the waiter pick their favorites for him and shawn stepped up to the plate ! <sssss> we started with my recommendation of the creamy , mouth-watering bone marrow . <sssss> but shawn 's pick , the green chili pork papusa was the table favorite . <sssss> then came the entrees . <sssss> i had a tender flat iron steak , my hubby had the trout , our kids had the flat iron steak and the pork belly and our guest had the sand dabs . <sssss> all of us were happy with our picks but most of all , we loved our sides . <sssss> we pushed them all in the middle of the table so we could share . <sssss> i had baby beets that were topped with an amazing sprinkle of cilantro , jalepeno and cashews , hubby had a roasted cauliflower with a curry sauce that melted in our mouths but shawn 's pick was the favorite of the table - dates with goat cheese and a sweet vinagrette that popped in your mouth when you took a swig of red wine -lrb- az stronghold magnus on tap - way to support our local wineries ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> next came a round of shots with infused fruit in the middle . <sssss> nice touch ! <sssss> then came the desserts and we were all very quiet as we ate . <sssss> i also do n't remember anyone wanting to share . <sssss> from a tantallizing , sweet creme brulee with banana , frozen raspberry , pretzel ice cream to shawn 's pick of navel orange sorbet doused with liquid nitrogen ... the presentation was incredible . <sssss> suffice it to say , this was an incredible experience ... we loved shawn . <sssss> and we ca n't wait to come back to try sunday brunch , lunch or just sit up at the bar . <sssss> the staff is so nice , we would just want sit and drink and relax . <sssss> we will be back !
HIG		omg ... i 'll start at the beginning . <sssss> waiting at the bar at this cute little house -lrb- used to be sophie 's bistro -rrb- for the maceachern 's to arrive . <sssss> our bartender , rachel , was so helpful , knowledgeable , cute , had us try litte cherry bomb shooters ... shots of vodka with a little cherry drop inside that explodes in your mouth . <sssss> their signature drinks were amazing as well . <sssss> thanks , rachel ! <sssss> then on to our table with our wonderful waitress , jessica . <sssss> all i can say is , we sat outside on this beautiful evening trying the most outlandish , unique , savory dishes . <sssss> first they bring you home made biscuits with honey butter . <sssss> then we shared thrice fried fries -lrb- say that five times fast -rrb- with three dipping sauces and -lrb- are you ready -rrb- garlic toast dipped in bone marrow -lrb- t was buttery , savory , mmmm -rrb- . <sssss> i had the parsnip soup ... so rich and creamy . <sssss> my entree was amy 's bolognese ... a garlic bread pudding with a bolognese sauce made w/beef & veal & tomatoes . <sssss> my hjusband had sand dabs and roasted brussel sprouts . <sssss> my son had a flat iron steak that melted in your mouth . <sssss> the presentation by the entire staff as they placed the dinners on our table was awesome . <sssss> but the best part was the peanut butter creme brulee with pretzels & banana ice cream . <sssss> binks is an adventure in the middle of phoenix . <sssss> i ca n't wait to go back .
MID		i 've never seen so many beers in my life . <sssss> and try the tacos stuffed with mashed sweet potatoes , green chilis and cheese . <sssss> yum ! <sssss> the place was packed on a saturday afternoon and now i know why . <sssss> so many more things to try on our next visit and definitely a lot more beer to try ! <sssss> i loved my beer , its # 31 ... some pilsner thing . <sssss> perfect for me .
MID		this is such a divine little neighborhood place . <sssss> the peach white sangria really hits the spot on a warm day . <sssss> the outside area is perfect for friends and listening to music . <sssss> try the crab tapas -lrb- yum -rrb- and the brie soup -lrb- even yummier -rrb- .
HIG		i just ca n't way enough about the service , food , and general ambience . <sssss> besides being warmly greeted by the owner , we had a perfecf table to show our guests -lrb- who used to own their own restaurant -rrb- what we 've been raving about . <sssss> and they are raving as well . <sssss> today we had rusty , the laid back waiter , who was wonderful ! <sssss> and the food ... all is know is , you have to try the hapu -lrb- hawaiian fish -rrb- lemongrass encrusted with slaw and rice . <sssss> i practically licked the plate . <sssss> and guess what i found out ... the ice cream shop next door , twirl , is co-owned by dana so you can walk over and bring it back to your table . <sssss> thanks again for making this a great evening .
HIG		our waitress , kate , outdid herself once again . <sssss> she was so attentive and took care of our out of town guests . <sssss> the place was hopping but she still made us feel like we were the only table she was attending . <sssss> yummy food ... but now i understand why they call them spicy edamames . <sssss> wow !
MID		its been almost a year since i 've been to timo and do n't know why i waited so long . <sssss> it was another near perfect lunch with a delightful waiter - thanks robbie - and one of the best bloody mary 's i 've ever had . <sssss> it was garnished with asparagus , olives and shaved paremsan and it was perfectly seasoned . <sssss> yum ! <sssss> had the timo trio which includes your choice of soup -lrb- went with the butternut squash this time -rrb- , salad dressed with cranberries and bacon , and the sandwich of the day on a delicious roll . <sssss> it was a perfect day to sit out on the back patio . <sssss> do n't think i 'll wait so long for my next trip .
MID		we decided to give them one more chance . <sssss> and i am so glad we did . <sssss> first of all , i commend the owner , candy , for responding to my previous yelp and coming to talk to us tonight at dinner . <sssss> she is a warm , friendly , lovely lady and i am so glad to have met her . <sssss> our server , amy , was great ... even before she knew we had put something negative on yelp . <sssss> the last time must have been an off time . <sssss> like my first time , it was awesome . <sssss> the menu is so eclectic , with a phillipine flavor . <sssss> their homemade brews ... tasty and refreshing ... and each one compliments the food on the menu . <sssss> canadian , french , english , phillipine , chicago dogs , kobe burgers , vegeteratian pizzas , something for everyone . <sssss> and the vanilla malts ... made from the malt used in their beers . <sssss> omg . <sssss> this is definitely a family run , work of art , place that needs to be supported . <sssss> you have won me back !
MID		not much to add to my review from july . <sssss> i had the same dinner , the same drink . <sssss> love it ... love it . <sssss> keep the margs and warm tortilla chips coming !
MID		my bf and i headed here last friday night after we decided some normal , comfort food was in order after scoping out a few other trendy places downtown on yelp . <sssss> while i typically do n't like restaurants located in a strip mall , this location did n't seem to ` mallish ' and there was ample parking . <sssss> we arrived around 8:30 pm and the place seemed pretty busy with an older crowd . <sssss> i think we were probably the youngest people in there . <sssss> old people know where good food is : -rrb- the patio seating might get a bit old with people walking in-between tables so we opted for something inside . <sssss> the atmosphere was dark but yet inviting . <sssss> we were greeted by a smiling hostest and seated as soon as we walked in . <sssss> our waitress came around quickly and gave us water and we had just the right amount of time to decide we would try the crispy eggplant bites for an appetizer and baby back ribs for me with a twice baked potato rather than fries and my bf 's grilled pork tenderloin . <sssss> having never had fried eggplant i envisioned almost chip like wedges of eggplant but these were more like patties . <sssss> and omg were they good ! <sssss> there were only 3 and we definitely fought over the last one and savored every bite ! <sssss> i 'm not usually a girl who orders ribs but these were definitely good . <sssss> the sauce was unique , a little smokey but not too much but they had really good flavor . <sssss> the coleslaw was really good , reminded me of kfc with a small punch of ginger and the twice baked potato put a smile on my face . <sssss> totally not on the diet but i did n't care . <sssss> my bf was really happy with his pork tenderloin and the small piece i had was really good . <sssss> he continued to comment throughout the meal how good it was so i know he liked it a lot . <sssss> to further ruin my diet , we ordered the warm chocolate torte . <sssss> it was good but one of those really strong , flour-less bunt cakes and they usually are n't my favorite . <sssss> overall , between the atmosphere , food and service , this is definitely a place we will come back to !
MID		came here last sunday for a late brunch after we looked around yelp at top brunch places . <sssss> with all the great reviews , we jumped in the car and were on our way . <sssss> parking was easy and we were greeted as soon as we walked in -lrb- by the owner i think -rrb- . <sssss> after looking over the menu i decided on the cobb salad and my fiance ordered the eggs benedict . <sssss> while i was n't overly excited about my salad choice , i was pleasantly surprised when it came out a short time later and looked wonderful . <sssss> lots of yummy ham and turkey and an entire plate full of good food . <sssss> the homemade vinaigrette on the salad was wonderful . <sssss> i was n't even hungry when we arrived and i ended up eating the whole salad . <sssss> my fiance called the eggs benedict ... ` amazing ' , ` wonderful ' , and ` some of the best he 'd ever had ' . <sssss> all in all , while its not the swankiest place inside , it is charming and i 'd definitely come back for that salad again !
MID		i 've been to the yard three times now and i was a little surprised by the low yelp rating when i looked it up . <sssss> while i 've had a good experience each time i 've come , i can understand how it could really go either way on any given night . <sssss> yes , it 's busy and the valet parking is everywhere in this area , but we 've always gotten taken care of immediately . <sssss> check in has always been great and the texting when your table is ready is soooo much better than those vibrating disks . <sssss> i 'm a huge ping pong player and while other 's have had a bad experience getting paddles , we 've always lucked out . <sssss> the first time we lucked into getting paddles by walking up to the first table and they were done . <sssss> the last time , it was slow enough on a friday night -lrb- which was a bit weird given my past two experiences where it was really crowed -rrb- that we did n't have anyone else playing and we were able to get them right away from the hostess . <sssss> we have never scored the bags but at the same time , i 'd much rather play ping pong so that is okay with me . <sssss> the food is pretty good and while i do think the pretzel bites are good , they are n't the best ever . <sssss> good but not something i would crave . <sssss> i 've gotten a few different things and i do like the chicken salad , though last time , it did seem a bit off . <sssss> other people in my parties have ordered the meatloaf and the chicken and seemed to like it . <sssss> our servers have always been prompt but i ca n't recall any of them being overly friendly and service does seem slow . <sssss> i do n't think it helps that this place is huge . <sssss> they probably get in several miles of walking every night . <sssss> i do remember one time that they could n't make our group some speciality shot a friend requested . <sssss> ca n't remember what exactly what it was but i did think it was weird . <sssss> it seems more of a speciality bar that only stocks certain things . <sssss> last trip we ordered the kona beer and it was served in a can . <sssss> while i 'm all for keeping up with the atmosphere and playing into the ` yard ' theme , canned beer is n't really my thing . <sssss> ca n't recall if she offered us cold glasses or not . <sssss> what i do love about this place is that it can be a whole evening . <sssss> entertainment , pretty good food and really good people watching . <sssss> last visit , there was a good band right out in the center and i enjoyed listening to them . <sssss> too often you go out to dinner and then do n't have much to do afterwards so its nice having an option for one stop shopping on date night . <sssss> overall , i like this place and love the atmosphere .
MID		i 'm slowly becoming more and more of a fan this place . <sssss> came here on a random monday morning after i 'd been craving pancakes and wanted a healthier choice . <sssss> this time i got more pecans and the pancakes really hit the spot . <sssss> since they are so big , i was only able to eat one . <sssss> i found out from the girl who cleared our table though that you are able to order a half order of the pancakes ! <sssss> yay ! <sssss> score for a $ 4 breakfast ! <sssss> in addition , i 'd been having a mad craving for a cinnamon roll for the past few weeks and i was surprised when i walked in and saw them in the display case . <sssss> i of course had to order one , diet be damned ! <sssss> it was fairly good sized and pretty good , definitely taking care of my craving !
MID		this place has become our go-to burger place ! <sssss> each time we go here , i ca n't seem to order anything else besides the zinburger and i do n't even like onions . <sssss> it must be something about them soaked in wine : -rrb- last visit i did try it low-carb style , without the bun , and it was definitely missing something so i 'll just have to workout extra hard when i know this place is on tap for dinner . <sssss> we also enjoy their zucchini fries with ranch , a lot ... but i 've had them three different times and each time have been different . <sssss> time number 2 was absolutely the best but i ca n't put my finger on what is happening different . <sssss> this place is usually fairly busy and it can make service a bit impersonal and a smidgen slow but we 've always gotten everything out without too long of a wait . <sssss> i 've also tried one of their shakes but honestly , ca n't really remember what it was so it was n't too memorable . <sssss> overall , a great , casual place for lunch or dinner . <sssss> love the patio too !
LOW		i had visited the vig arcadia sometime last year and was underwhelmed at my experience but seeing a local dines for the vig uptown , i decided it would be worth trying it again at a different location . <sssss> we tried to call ahead and get on the list around 6:15 pm on friday night . <sssss> while they do n't let you call ahead and put your name on the list , the hostess said it would only be a 20-30 minute wait and she thought it could be faster so even though we were starving , we decided to head out . <sssss> we arrived about 30 minutes later and the valet parking was a bit confusing . <sssss> we pulled up to the valet stand and no one was there . <sssss> just beyond the stand there was a sign that said the lot was full so i got out and looked around for someone to help us . <sssss> about that time , the valet came up while i was still standing next to the car . <sssss> he instructed my fiance to pull up the car another 20 feet to the front door and then took the car to be parked . <sssss> not sure why he could n't have taken it there and it seemed a little odd but i figured they were pretty busy . <sssss> we entered and no one was at the hostess stand initially . <sssss> someone appeared a few minutes later but did n't seem to be in charge of the area and ignored me . <sssss> finally , a friendly hostess appeared and put us down and said it would be 20-30 minutes . <sssss> we stood in the corner since the 4 cube seats were taken . <sssss> i thought about maybe sitting on the patio to wait until every person that come from outside reeked like smoke . <sssss> i overheard her mention to someone else that it was the ` smokers patio ' ... so much for fresh air so you might keep that in mind if you 're hoping to sit outside . <sssss> after a 35 minute wait , we were finally taken to our table . <sssss> as we sat down in our booth and realized how loud it was , we decided to sit on the same side so we could hear each other . <sssss> it was crowded but it still should n't have been as loud as it was . <sssss> our waitress came after a few minutes and took our drink and appetizer order . <sssss> we opted for the wings and the tater tots . <sssss> someone arrived with the wings a few minutes later and we figured the tots would be out shortly . <sssss> with the wings nearly gone , she finally came back to check on us and when we asked about the tot 's , she said she had n't heard our order and she would get them out fast . <sssss> totally could n't blame her though since it was so loud . <sssss> i did n't try the wings but my fiance said they were ` okay ' . <sssss> we ordered the carne asada to share for dinner , figuring the tots would fill us up . <sssss> shortly after she left , the tots came out . <sssss> while they were huge and i think you get 6 or 7 , they were n't great . <sssss> the first one i ate had no cheese in it and the dipping sauce did n't taste like much . <sssss> the tots did n't have a whole lot of flavor either and i would have preferred frozen ore ida over these ! <sssss> i kept trying to salt them but nothing helped . <sssss> i asked the person who brought the tots for a side of ranch and also a refill on my drink . <sssss> the ranch arrived a few minutes later and then the refill another 3-5 minutes after that . <sssss> we did finally receive our dinner too and while it was very tender and had good flavor , our whole experience so far had kind of trumped the dinner . <sssss> our waitress disappeared forever and never came to check back on us to see how our dinner was . <sssss> when she eventually did reappear , she apologized for the wait and i think she said ` sorry for the wait , i kept cutting myself and i had to take care of that first ' ... huh ? <sssss> i still am not 100 % sure what she said but that 's sure what it sounded like . <sssss> she did bring the bill and thankfully our bill was only $ 7 after the local dines credit . <sssss> it took another lengthy amount of time to get the check to sign but she did apologize ... again ... for taking so long . <sssss> when we left , we were at least thanked for coming in . <sssss> when we walked out someone held the door open for us and thanked us too . <sssss> then began another valet fiasco . <sssss> our car was 3rd in line parked and just across from the valet stand . <sssss> we walked up to the stand but nobody was there except a man , who i assumed was waiting for his car . <sssss> then someone appeared , took out our keys and then said he would be back to help us and laid our keys on the stand . <sssss> having our car 20 feet away and rather than have to wait around for him to help someone else and then pull out our car , we grabbed our keys and started walking over to our car . <sssss> instead , we were scalded by another valet that he would move our car and informed us ` there is a line ' . <sssss> you mean the one guy now standing by the valet being helped ? <sssss> whatever . <sssss> i get these urban places have crappy parking but this whole valet is such a joke . <sssss> i know they have a system for how they get cars in and out of the parking lot but its chaotic and they were never friendly and we were just ready to go . <sssss> at this point , both the vig 's have struck out in my opinion and i 'll find other places to dine . <sssss> one star for the ambiance -lrb- because it 's swanky inside and might be a cool patio but it would be so much more enjoyable without all the noise -rrb- and another for ... the carne asada ?
LOW		i 'd been looking forward to eating at this restaurant for several months as it always seemed to pop up when i was looking for places to eat around downtown . <sssss> this particular friday night was finally a night where both my boyfriend and i decided that some good mexican food was in order and we arrived just after 8pm . <sssss> we arrive and park in back and had no problems finding a parking spot . <sssss> we come through the back door which is always slightly intimidating in my opinion but we stroll on through and make our way to the hostest stand . <sssss> we were met by a man who asked how many in our party and our name . <sssss> no smile or a welcoming hello . <sssss> maybe he was just having a bad day . <sssss> we were told we had a 20 minute wait . <sssss> we walk the 5 steps over the bar and decide to order a beer while we waited . <sssss> unfortunately , the bartender had just stepped away and did n't come back for at least another 15 minutes . <sssss> as we finally order our beer and she hands them to us , our table is ready . <sssss> we are sat on the other side of the restaurant , near the back of the room next to the waiter stand with the registers and the bathroom . <sssss> i hate getting sat back here . <sssss> i get that someone has to sit there but for me , it takes away from the whole experience of the restaurant and clearly dampens the ambiance . <sssss> our waiter arrived after another wait and he must have been having a bad day too because there was no smile , no hello , it was just `` what would you like to drink ? ' <sssss> and a quick run down of their menu . <sssss> at this point i 'm beginning to think that maybe this place is n't known for their service and am hopeful their food will make up for it . <sssss> we order the tableside guacamole . <sssss> i get that this is normally an expensive appetizer and you pay for the presentation but for the price , you usually get someone who does n't have a scowl on their face and using the shabby metal cart that was sitting next to us at the waiter stand . <sssss> all the extra ingredients for the guac were placed under a towel and once he finished , he placed the towel back over it and wheeled it back into the corner . <sssss> fancy . <sssss> the guac was good but not worth the cost in my opinion . <sssss> i will be adding pomegranate seeds to my own this summer though as that was an interesting addition and would be great in the summer ! <sssss> my boyfriend ordered a dish that was some sort of pepper stuffed with meat and cheese that he liked but did n't finish , which is a rarity for him . <sssss> i ordered their house special , the cochinita pibil which is a slow roasted pork with steamed veggies and mashed potatoes . <sssss> the pork tasted like something that could have come out of my crockpot . <sssss> yes it was tender and the flavor was ... well , like a pork roast . <sssss> nothing special about it at all . <sssss> the mashed potatoes had some additional ingredients and were the best thing on my plate but the steamed veggies were just that , with a little seasoning . <sssss> pretty bland . <sssss> overall , between the lack luster service , sitting in the worst spot in the restaurant , and the okay food , we have to many other places to try and will never be back .
LOW		went here for a date night last night with my fiance with a local dines coupon in tow . <sssss> i 've been wanting to try this place for awhile after seeing the lights driving down camelback a few times and the local dines deal finally got us there . <sssss> the place is really cool inside . <sssss> i love these kinds of atmosphere 's with awesome mood lighting , friendly faces and the promise of a great meal . <sssss> we opted for inside since their patio area only really looked good for drinks and while the hostess was friendly , we were sat on the bar side of the restaurant at a small table for two , directly in between two other couples . <sssss> i almost asked to sit elsewhere just because i hate being able to hear other 's conversations at dinner and not being able to hear my own but i figured i 'd just go with it for one time since the place did seem fairly busy , though there were a few open tables . <sssss> i ca n't say that sitting on the other side of the restaurant would have been any quieter though . <sssss> as soon as we sat down , we realized that it was really loud . <sssss> when i made a comment to my fiance about how loud it was , he yelled back ` what ??? ' <sssss> ... not a good sign for a nice romantic dinner . <sssss> our waiter was really friendly but did have to almost yell at us to get the specials across . <sssss> this place could definitely use some sound dampening . <sssss> it was extremely loud the through the whole dinner and it really took the ` romantic ' vibe down a notch since you did n't want to have to yell or repeat yourself through the whole dinner . <sssss> for drinks , we started out with two glasses of their lemonade usually served in a pitcher . <sssss> while they were strong and not overly sweet , i do think they lacked a bit of flavor for being made with lemonade but they were refreshing . <sssss> we decided rather than try their drunk bread to share , i 'd order the wedge salad and my fiance try their oysters . <sssss> for entree 's , he got the filet oscar and while i initially wanted a filet too , i thought i would branch out and get the chicken parmesan since i had remembered this place was listed as italian on yelp . <sssss> the bread they served before dinner was good and i really liked the butter . <sssss> it had a slight hint of sweetness and herbs which oddly worked really well . <sssss> our appetizers came and i ca n't say i 'd get the wedge salad again . <sssss> the lettuce was weird , it was more like lettuce leaves rather than a wedge of lettuce and i did n't care for the ranch dressing . <sssss> it was watery and not the most flavorful . <sssss> the bacon was good though and i do n't even eat bacon . <sssss> my fiance did say they oysters were good but they did seem really small . <sssss> our entree 's came out and mine was huge ! <sssss> the breaded chicken almost took up my whole plate and was covered in cheese only . <sssss> there was a side dish of the marinara which was odd and probably a good thing . <sssss> i was n't overly found of their rendition of it . <sssss> it seemed just a little off , though i ca n't pinpoint exactly what was wrong with it . <sssss> additionally , the side of mac n cheese it came with i did n't care for either . <sssss> my fiance thought it was good though and actually though it was better than switch 's wine bar , which i think hands down is worth getting fat for . <sssss> try it if you have n't ! <sssss> this dish , not so much and i only had a few bites . <sssss> i did have a bite of the filet and it was really good . <sssss> good flavor , a nice seared outside and very tender , but maybe a hint of dryness . <sssss> overall , the atmosphere was very nice but loud , the server was great and the food in my opinion was a 5 out of 10 . <sssss> i think we may come back sometime and try their $ 12 pitchers of sangria at happy hour and try their drunk bread . <sssss> not sure i 'd come back for dinner though .
LOW		came here for lunch with a friend today . <sssss> i had remember reading about the asian nachos on yelp and we ordered the small , without chicken . <sssss> they were so yummy ! <sssss> definitely something i would go back for . <sssss> my friend and i were both pretty hungry and we polished off the small with no problem between the two of us . <sssss> she ordered the pad thai noodles and i opted for the california roll , with the real crab meat for the $ 1 up-charge . <sssss> my friend said her dish was okay but she left a lot on her plate , though it was a huge portion . <sssss> my cali roll was pretty good , but kind of dry . <sssss> i do n't think i 've ever left a piece of sushi on my plate and i actually did this time around . <sssss> i was n't overly full either though so i think it just was n't that great . <sssss> it was a pretty large roll , 8 pieces , and each piece required two bites rather than the normal one piece , one bite . <sssss> service was pretty good . <sssss> our waitress kept our glasses full but disappear when we were waiting to pay . <sssss> she also charged the wrong credit card for each of our tabs but corrected it , hopefully . <sssss> overall , i 'd definitely go back for those nachos and to try something else on the menu .
LOW		i am so sad to have to write this review . <sssss> my boyfriend and i visited here for spa week yesterday and were really disappointed . <sssss> having stayed at the montelucia as a hotel guest and an occasional lunch and dinner , i knew we could expect five star service , food and amenities and i was really excited to try this spa . <sssss> when i saw it was having a spa week special for $ 79 for an 50min massage , i jumped on the opportunity ! <sssss> unfortunately , the joya spa did n't live up to my expectations . <sssss> booking over the phone was easy and i called prior to our massages to see if we would have access to the main pool post massage and to see if my bf and i could have a couples massage with the special . <sssss> unfortunately , they could n't accomodate us as a couple and ` spa only ' guests are n't allowed to the main pool but we did have access to the spa rooftop pool . <sssss> after looking at pictures and reading reviews , i was still excited . <sssss> upon entering the spa , we checked in with a smile-less hostest . <sssss> the checkin area had two other guests so i was hopeful that spa week , on a monday at 1pm was slow and we could get the full experience . <sssss> my bf and i and another guest were led up the stairs and given the tour . <sssss> as a few have said , there are a few hokey parts about this spa . <sssss> i love crystals as much as the next person but the whole ceremony where you pick your stone and then put your hand on the bigger crystal to say some sort of wish or prayer seemed a bit ... well ... cheesy ... i could tell my bf just wanted to laugh but we went along with it . <sssss> i 'm all for trying something if it 'll get me in a zen mental zone and relaxed . <sssss> around the corner , my bf and i were seperated into our own locker rooms . <sssss> this normally is the case at spas but it would have been nice to get a little extra instruction on how to meet back up once our treatments were over . <sssss> they swept us off into opposite directions so we had to coordinate via text . <sssss> cell phone signals were n't the best either so if you go with a partner , make sure you have a plan beforehand . <sssss> the facilities are nice and i liked having my own personal locker with keycode . <sssss> the spa was pretty busy with spa week though and as someone else mentioned , it definitely had more of a vibe of ` girls time ' rather than ` relax time ' . <sssss> waiting in the ` social ' room for my services definitely felt more social than relaxing . <sssss> my therapist joel came to get me 5 minutes after my scheduled 1pm appointment . <sssss> joel took me back to the treatment room and the room was pretty uninspired . <sssss> dark , a mirror on the wall and i think a small table with some water . <sssss> when we went through the usual ` what do you want in your massage , ' i mentioned that i had a headache to which he responded something like , ` who know 's what could have caused it ' and it was quickly dismissed . <sssss> i was just going to ask for a little extra neck attention but he did n't seem interested ? <sssss> he left the room for all of 45 seconds but luckily i usually hurry to get on the bed so he did n't catch me mid-table-mount . <sssss> lol now for the massage ... i 'm sorry but this was the worst massage i 've ever had . <sssss> it was uninspired , never felt like he was in the right area and a few of the techniques i wanted to laugh . <sssss> he pulled the foot rest out from under me without supporting my legs , wiped my hands with hot towels and left them dangling off the side of the bed , ran into the chair several times in the corner and gave a very awkward , 10 second head massage at the end . <sssss> i do n't know if he was brought in to help with the busy week but its suffice to say i was glad it was over after 50 minutes . <sssss> when i finally met back up with my bf , he informed me that his massage was terrible too and that he was cut short 10 minutes from his massage . <sssss> lucky him ! <sssss> besides the disastrous massages , we had decided that we were going to have lunch poolside and luckily we were able to get chaise loungers right by the pool that were comfy . <sssss> service was slow and my turkey burger was pretty bland . <sssss> i was served my salad in a bowl where the sealant was coming off . <sssss> i do n't think i ate any of it but it was a little shocking to see once i finished my salad and noticed it . <sssss> the view of camelback is nice but i would have perferred the main pool with its sprawling views of the mountain and resort . <sssss> upon check out i had been expecting the 20 % additional tip included so i asked carlos to adjust it accordingly . <sssss> when he asked why , we told him that our services were not in line with 20 % and that we did n't like our massages . <sssss> he just said ` okay ' . <sssss> other staff members were behind the desk and did n't seem to care either and we paid for our massages . <sssss> he added too much for the tip for my bf 's treatment but at that point , the extra $ 1 did n't matter and we wanted to get the hell out of there . <sssss> the only reason i 'm giving it two stars is that i know what the montelucia is capable of and for the atmosphere of the resort as a whole . <sssss> maybe we just had a bad experience because of spa week ? <sssss> i 'm not going back to find out .
LOW		this past weekend we were celebrating my birthday with a little staycation up the road at royal palms and since i had read this place had the best steaks in phoenix , i decided to give it a try since i love a good steak on my birthday . <sssss> admittedly , i 'm a bit of a filet snob since i grew up in the midwest and we have some of the best steaks i 've had anywhere in the world . <sssss> i drive by this place all the time and its outside apparence looks like a typical , run of the mill steakhouse so i never considered it but when a living social deal was offered , it prompted us to give it a try and i thought maybe the inside had something great to offer . <sssss> we called several times the day before to try and change our reservation time but only got their answering machine on a sunday . <sssss> i doubt they were closed so i 'm not sure what was going on with that . <sssss> we decided the original time worked for us anyway so we made our way there . <sssss> upon arrival we were greeted by very friendly and welcoming valet . <sssss> when we stepped inside it was a tiny bit of a let down . <sssss> it was the standard , dark wood , white table cloth steakhouse that looks just about every other one i 've been to . <sssss> the reception staff was very friendly and one woman happily agreed to take our picture while the other hostest went to check on our booth . <sssss> she returned shortly and took us to a booth without any waiting . <sssss> while i 'm not fond of the u shaped booth that 's always awkward to sit in , no matter how many are in your party , it was pretty comfy and we settled in . <sssss> our team of servers were nice and prompt with water , bread and telling us about the specials . <sssss> no one ever asked if we were celebrating anything special so it never came up that it was my birthday . <sssss> it was nice to see that the potato and vegetables were included in the price of the steaks rather than al a cart . <sssss> other sides were average priced for a steakhouse at about $ 11-15 i think . <sssss> i opted for the 8oz filet , medium , with a baked potato and requested that i substitue my vegetables for a side of creamed spinach . <sssss> unfortunately they could n't accomodate a direct substitution so we ended up paying for a full side of the spinach and also of the mac n cheese with bacon . <sssss> my fiance ordered the cajun ribeye . <sssss> the bread and butter were good , but nothing different or extraordinary . <sssss> when our dinner arrived , it looked really good . <sssss> instead of loading the potato in the kitchen , the waiter had a server with all the potato toppings and offered as much butter and sour cream as i wanted , nice touch . <sssss> the sides of spinach and mac n cheese were big portions and looked delicious . <sssss> my first cut into the steak was perfect and it was perfect throughout . <sssss> while the tenderness was superb , you could cut it with a fork , and the flavor was good , there was nothing that set this apart from the rest of the other steaks you can get elsewhere like a ruth 's chris or capital grill . <sssss> zero seasoning so all you got was meat . <sssss> luckily i went all out on the sour cream for my potato because otherwise , it was very dry . <sssss> the creamed spinach was really good but i did n't care for the mac n cheese . <sssss> it seemed a bit dry to me and the bacon bits on it almost tasted like bacon bits from a jar . <sssss> i would have preferred velvetta shells and cheese to this . <sssss> my fiances ribeye was also cooked perfectly and the taste i had , it was really good . <sssss> the staff continued to check on us through out the meal and we opted not to order dessert because we were so full . <sssss> there was no issue using the living social deal and the meal ended up costing about $ 100 once we used the deal pricing . <sssss> overall , good service , mediocre steak and average sides . <sssss> the ambiance was standard steakhouse with little to differentiate itself from anywhere else . <sssss> our meal was good but i do n't think i 'd ever come back .
